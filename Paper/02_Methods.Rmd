## 2.1 Acoustic detection of beaked whales

The Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) is an instrumented U.S. Naval range extending 70 km NW of the island of Kauai, Hawaii and encompassing 2,800 km^2^.  The range includes a cabled hydrophone array (Fig. 1) with hydrophones at depths ranging from approximately 650 m to 4,700 m. Hydrophones had a sample rate of 96 kHz, with the high pass filter on each phone set at either 50 Hz, 100 Hz, or 10 kHz.  Up to 62 of the range hydrophones at a time can be recorded simultaneously by the Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC).  The Navy Acoustic Range WHale AnaLysis (NARWHAL) algorithm suite includes a Blainville’s beaked whale detector that first compares signal-to-noise (SNR) thresholds within the expected beaked whale click frequency range (16 - 44 kHz) versus the bandwidth outside the click in a running 16384-pt fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrogram. The detected clicks are then passed to a 64-pt FFT stage that measures power, bandwidth, slope, and duration characteristics to classify the clicks to species. This process is followed by an automated routine in Matlab (CITE Mathworks 2019) used to group detections of individual beaked whale echolocation clicks into Group Vocal Periods (GVPs). If a group of whales is detected by more than one hydrophone, the GVP is assigned to the hydrophone that recorded the most clicks. The data are then aggregated to indicate the presence or absence of the start of a GVP for each hydrophone within each half-hour period. In the present study, we used data collected before and during Submarine Commander Courses (SCCs) at the PMRF. SCCs occur biannually in February and August. SCCs typically last 6-7 days, and the period before the onset of the SCC is recorded for a minimum of 2 days.

## 2.2 Modelling received levels of hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar

Classified ship positional data and other activity that occurs on the range during each SCC are provided by PMRF. This data indicate the locations of the ships during the training periods and also indicate the start and stop times of each individual training event, but no information is provided on the start and stop of sonar use. Periods of active sonar are determined by running the sonar detector tuned to mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar, as part of the NARWHAL algorithm suite. Using these data, the locations of all surface ships are noted for each half-hour period and the closest ship to each hydrophone is determined. Propagation modelling is used to calculate the expected received level of hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar at the location of each hydrophone from the closest ship during each half-hour period of each SCC. The propagation modelling is done using the parabolic equation propagation model in the program Peregrine (OASIS; Heaney and Campbell, 2016) to estimate the transmission loss between the ship and the hydrophone; this was then converted to a received level at the hydrophone location based on the source level of the sonar. However, if the distance between the ship and the hydrophone was less than the depth of the water column, the parabolic equation overestimates transmission loss at that angle and so a simple sonar equation was used to estimate transmission loss instead. Transmission loss is estimated using a 200 Hz band around the center frequency of the sonar type (here, 3.5 kHz). Transmission loss is estimated at depth since Blainville’s beaked whales don’t begin clicking until they have reached approximately XX m depth of their foraging dive and spend most of their foraging dive at around 1000 m (REF). For hydrophones shallower than 1000 m the received level is estimated at a point 20 m above the sea floor with a +/- 10 m buffer, while for hydrophones deeper than 1000 m the received level is estimated at 1000 m depth with a +/- 10 m buffer. The location of the beaked whale foraging group is assumed to be within 4-6 km of the hydrophone with the most click detections, as beaked whale echolocation clicks attenuate beyond that distance [@mccarthy_changes_2011; @marques_estimating_2009]. Therefore the transmission loss is estimated along the radial from the ship to the hydrophone from a distance of 1 km before the hydrophone to 1 km past the hydrophone in 200 m increments. The maximum modeled received level along that radial was determined for each hydrophone and half-hour period and aggregated with the data on beaked whale group detections. Uncertainty in the modelled received level was not considered.

## 2.3 Spatial Modelling

Modelling methods are described in detail in the following sections.  Briefly, we first used a tesselation to determine the area effectively monitored by each hydrophone.  Then, we used pre-activity data to create a spatial model of the probability of GVPs prior to the onset of Naval activity.  We used the predicted values from this model as an offset in a model created using data from when Naval activity was present on the range, but MFA sonar was not.  Again, we used the predicted values from this model as an offset in a model created using data when Naval activity and MFA sonar were present on the range.  Finally, we used posterior simulation to calculate confidence intervals and quantified the change in the probability of GVPs when Naval activity was present and across received levels of MFA sonar.

### 2.3.1 Determining hydrophone effort

For security reasons, randomly "jittered" locations and depths of hydrophones at PMRF were used.  We projected the coordinates of each hydrophone into Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 4. 

Because the beaked whale detection algorithm assigns groups of whales to the hydrophone that recorded the most echolocation clicks, and because the spatial separation of the hydrophones is not uniform, effort is not the same for all hydrophones.  To determine the area effectively monitored by each hydrophone, we used a Voronoi tesselation implemented in the \textsf{R} [@r_core_team_r:_2018] package \texttt{deldir} [@turner_deldir:_2019] to define a tile for each hydrophone that contained all points on the range that were closest to that hydrophone.  The area of each tile corresponds to the effective area monitored.  We assume that beaked whale groups occur within the tesselation tile of the hydrophone to which the GVP is assigned.  For hydrophones on the outside of the range, i.e., not surrounded by other hydrophones, we used a cutoff radius of 6500 m to bound the tesselation tile.  This distance is based on the maximum detection distance of individual Blainville's beaked whale clicks at a U.S. Naval range in the Bahamas [@marques_estimating_2009]. Different combinations of hydrophones were used during different SCCs, so separate tesselations were created for each SCC.

### 2.3.2 M1: Modelling the pre-activity probability of dive detection

We used data collected prior to SCCs, when no Naval ships were present on the range and no other Naval activity was known to occur, to determine the baseline probability of GVPs at each hydrophone.  The exact locations of beaked whale groups is not known; rather, detections of beaked whale groups are "snapped" to hydrophone locations depending on which hydrophone detected the most echolocation clicks.  Therefore, the data are not continuous in space.  To account for this, we used a Markov random field to model the spatial distribution of GVPs.  A Markov random field [@rue_gaussian_2005] is a method for modelling correlation in space between discrete spatial units. Each unit is correlated more strongly with its neighbours (those units which touch) than those that are more hops away. This gives a graph-like structure, where ``number of hops'' is the distance used to calculate relatedness, rather than geographical distance. This is appropriate for our data as we do not know where in each tile a given GVP occurs, but we assume that it does occur in that tile.

The R package \texttt{mgcv} [@wood_generalized_2017] was used to formulate the model on the tesselation described in the previous section. The linear predictor for the model was:
\begin{equation}
    \text{logit}\left(\mu_{\texttt{M1},i}\right) = \beta_{\texttt{M1},0} +  f(\texttt{MRF}_i) + f(\texttt{Depth}_i) + \log_e A_i, \qquad (\texttt{M1})
\end{equation}
where $\texttt{DivePresent}_i \sim \text{Bin}(1, _{\texttt{M1},i})$. The spatial smooth MRF is given by $f(\texttt{MRF}_i)$, $f(\texttt{Depth}_i)$ is a smooth of depth (using a thin plate spline) and $\log_e A_i$ is an offset for the area (in $\text{km}^2$) of each tile, $A_i$. The offset term accounts changes in probabilities of detection due to the differing area monitored per hydrophones.  Because the hydrophone tesselations change between SCCs, separate MRFs were used for each SCC, but a single smoothing parameter was estimated across all MRFs. Therefore different spatial patterns could occur, but with the same amount of variation. The smooth of depth was shared across SCCs.

NOTE: f(MRF) could be indexed by SCC to indicate that the smooth function is different for each.

### 2.3.3 M2: Modelling the effect of Naval activity

For a few days prior to the onset of hull-mounted MFA sonar used during SCCs, other Naval training activities occur at the PMRF.  Various vessels are present on the range during this period and other noise sources, including torpedoes and submarines, may be present.  We used data collected when training activity was present on the range, but hull-mounted MFA sonar was not used, to model the effect of general Naval activity on beaked whale GVPs.  Initially, we tried to use low-frequency noise levels in the 10-999 Hz range measured on range hydrophones as a covariate in this model, but found that the measured noise levels were not consistent with known locations of Naval training activities (see Appendix B for details).  

We used the predicted baseline probability of a GVP from Model 1 as an offset to control for the underlying spatial distribution of GVPs.  The model for the data when ships were present was intercept-only, with an offset derived from \texttt{M1}. This model was simply:
\begin{equation}
    \text{logit}\left(\mu_{\texttt{M2},i}\right) = \beta_{\texttt{M2},0} + \log_e \xi_{\texttt{M1}, i}, \qquad (\texttt{M2})
\end{equation}
where $\texttt{DivePresent}_i \sim \text{Bin}(1, \mu_{\texttt{M2},i})$. $\xi_{\texttt{M1}, i}$ denotes the prediction (on the $\text{logit}$ scale) for tile $i$ using model $\texttt{M1}$. This was again modelled in the R package \texttt{mgcv}.

### 2.3.4 M3: Modelling the effect of hull-mounted MFA sonar

We used data collected when hull-mounted MFA sonar was present on the range to model the effect of sonar on beaked whales. The probability of a dive when sonar was present was modelled as a function of the maximum received level (modelled at each hydrophone; see section 2.2). We assumed that as the maximum received level increased, the probability of dives decreased and modelled this using a shape constrained smooth so that the relationship held for all possible realizations of the smooth. To ensure that the model predictions were the same at a maximum received level of 0 dB and when ships were not present, we did not include an intercept. This model was written as:
\begin{equation}
    \text{logit}\left(\mu_{\texttt{M3},i}\right) = f(\texttt{MaxRL}_i) + \log_e \xi_{\texttt{M2}, i}, \qquad (\texttt{M3})
\end{equation}
where $\texttt{DivePresent}_i \sim \text{Bin}(1, \mu_{\texttt{M3},i})$. $f(\texttt{MaxRL}_i)$ was modelled as a monotonic decreasing smooth using the R package \texttt{scam} [@pya_shape_2015]. $\xi_{\texttt{M2}, i}$ denotes the prediction (on the $\text{logit}$ scale) for tile $i$ when Naval training activites were present on the range using model $\texttt{M2}$. 

### 2.3.5 Uncertainty propagation

We used posterior simulation to propagate uncertainty through M1, M2, and M3. Each model was fitted via restricted maximum likelihood [REML; @wood_fast_2008], so the results are empirical Bayes estimates. In this case we can generate samples from the (multivariate normal) posterior of the model parameters. After generating a sample, $\boldsymbol{\beta}^* \sim \text{MVN}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, \textbf{V}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}})$, we can use the matrix that maps the model parameters to the predictions on the linear predictor scale [often referred to as the $\mathbf{L}_p$ matrix or $\mathbf{X}_p$ matrix; @wood_generalized_2017; section 7.2.6], along with the inverse link function to generate predictions for each posterior sample. Here the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ for each model includes the coefficients for the smooth terms in the model and fixed effects (e.g., intercept) if present. Predictions, $\boldsymbol{\mu}^*$, can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{\mu}^* = g^{-1}(\eta^*) = g^{-1}(\mathbf{X}_p\boldsymbol{\beta}^*+\boldsymbol{\xi}),
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the link function, $\eta^*$ is the linear predictor and $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ is any offset used by this prediction. By sampling from the posterior of $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, and then taking the variance of the resulting $\mathbf{p}^*$s we can obtain variance estimates [@wood_generalized_2017; section 7.2.6]. The prediction grid contained all possible combinations of covariates within the realized covariate space; i.e., each hydrophone for each SCC with associated location, hydrophone depth, and area of the tesselation tile, presence/absence of Naval activity, and, if Naval activity present, then either sonar absence or sonar received level between 35 and 190 dB in intervals of 5 dB.    

This procedure needs to happen for each model, updating the offsets and refitting as it goes. 

An algorithm for calculating the variance from our multi-stage approach is as follows. First define $N_b$ as the number of samples to make, let $\mathbf{X}_{p,\texttt{M}j}$ for $j=1,2,3$ be the $\mathbf{L}_p$ matrix that maps coefficients to the predictions for model $\texttt{M}j$. For $N_b$ times:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a sample from the posterior of $\texttt{M1}$:  $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_\texttt{M1}\sim\text{MVN}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_\texttt{M1}, \mathbf{V}_\texttt{M1})$.
    \item Calculate a new offset for $\texttt{M2}$, $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_{\texttt{M1}} = \mathbf{X}_{p,\texttt{M1}} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_\texttt{M1} + \log_e \mathbf{A}$.
    \item Refit $\texttt{M2}$ with $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_{\texttt{M1}}$ as the offset, to obtain $\texttt{M2}^\prime$.
    \item Draw a sample from the posterior of $\texttt{M2}^\prime$:  $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\texttt{M2}^\prime} \sim\text{MVN}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_{\texttt{M2}^\prime}, \mathbf{V}_{\texttt{M2}^\prime})$
    \item Calculate a new offset for $\texttt{M3}$, $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_{\texttt{M2}} = \mathbf{X}_{p,\texttt{M2}} \tilde{\boldsymbol{\beta}}_\texttt{M2}^\prime + \tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_{\texttt{M1}}$ (predictions for the sonar data locations for $\texttt{M2}^\prime$).
    \item Refit $\texttt{M3}$ with offset $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_{\texttt{M2}}$ to obtain $\texttt{M3}^\prime$.
    \item Predict $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M1}^\prime}$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M2}^\prime}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M3}^\prime}$ over prediction grid and store them.
\end{enumerate}
We can then calculate summary statistics (means and variances) of the $N_b$ values of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M1}^\prime}$, $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M2}^\prime}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M3}^\prime}$ we have generated. The empirical variance of the $N_b$ values of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\texttt{M3}^\prime}$ will give the uncertainty, incorporating components from all three models. We can take appropriate quantiles to form confidence intervals for the functional relationships between [TKTKTK noisey boi] and [TKTKTK whaley boi].

### 2.3.6 Quantifying the change in probability of GVPs

Finally, we calculated the expected change in the probability of GVPs relative to either the distribution of GVPs when no general Naval training activity was present and no MFA sonar was present ($\Delta_{M3':M1'}$), or relative to the distribution of GVPs general Naval training activity was present but no MFA sonar was present ($\Delta_{M3':M2'}$).

Using the $N_b$ bootstrapped model realizations we calculated the expected probability of a GVP under each set of covariates as
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP}) = \text{logit}^{-1} (\mu_{\texttt{M}^\prime} ),
\end{equation}
for each $\texttt{M1}^\prime$, $\texttt{M2}^\prime$, and $\texttt{M3}^\prime$.  Then, we calculated the change in $\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})$ for each set of covariates $\texttt{M3}^\prime$ and $\texttt{M1}^\prime$ ($\Delta_{M3':M1'}$) and between $\texttt{M3}^\prime$ and $\texttt{M2}^\prime$ ($\Delta_{M3':M2'}$) for each realization of the bootstrap. 
\begin{align}
\Delta_{M3':M1'} &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M3}^\prime} -  \mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M1}^\prime}}{\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M1}^\prime}}\\
\Delta_{M3':M2'} &= \frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M3}^\prime} -  \mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M2}^\prime}}{\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})_{\texttt{M2}^\prime}}
\end{align}
For each received level we calcualted the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantiles of $\Delta_{M3':M1'}$ and $\Delta_{M3':M2'}$ to create 95\% CIs of change in $\mathbb{P}(\text{GVP})$ across possible received levels.  We consider that the probability of disturbance is equal to 1 wherever the 95\% CI does not include 0, and 0 otherwise.
