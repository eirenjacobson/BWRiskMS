# S3: Single GAM {.unlisted .unnumbered}

A single GAM could be used to quantify the effect of naval sonar on Blainville's beaked whales. Here, we present such a model and compare the results to the results obtained using the multi-stage model presented in the main text of the manuscript.  

We modelled the probability of a GVP at tile $i$ in SCC $s$ at time $t$ as a Bernoulli trial: $\texttt{GVP}_{i,s,t} \sim \text{Bin}(1, \mu_{i,s,t})$. The linear predictor for on the logit scale was given as:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{logit}\left(\mu_{i,s,t}\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\texttt{NavTrain}_{t} +  f(\texttt{MRF}_{i,s}) + f(\texttt{Depth}_i) + f(\texttt{MaxRL}_i,t)\texttt{Sonar}_{t} + \log_e A_i)
\end{equation*}
where $\beta_{0}$ is an intercept, $\beta_{1}\texttt{NavTrain}_{t}$ is the effect of naval training times an indicator variable for whether naval training was present or absent at time $t$,  $f(\texttt{MRF}_{i,s})$ denotes the Markov random field used to smooth space, $f(\texttt{Depth}_i)$ is a smooth of depth (using a thin plate spline; Wood et al. 2003), $f(\texttt{MaxRL}_{i,t})\texttt{Sonar}_{t}$ is a monotonically decreasing smooth of sonar received level (using a thin plate spline) times an indicator variable for whether sonar was present or absent at time $t$, and $\log_e A_i$ is an offset for the area (in $\text{km}^2$) of each tile, $A_i$.

We fit the model using \texttt{scam} (Pya et al. 2015).

This single GAM predicts a 64\% decrease in $P(\text{GVP})$ when naval training is present compared to the baseline period, which is the same decrease predicted by the multi-stage GAM.  However, the single GAM predicts that at a MFAS received level of 150 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa, $P(\text{GVP})$ will decrease by 64\% relative to when only naval training is present, whereas the multi-stage model predicts a decrease of 78\%. Similarly, the single GAM predicts that at a MFAS received level of 150 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa, $P(\text{GVP})$ will decrease by 87\% relative to baseline, whereas the muti-stage model predicts a 92\% decrease. Relative to when only naval training is present, the single GAM predicts a 50\% reduction in $P(\text{GVP})$ at a MFAS received level of 144 dB, whereas the multi-stage model predicts a 50\% reduction at a MFAS received level of 135 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa.

The major difference between this single GAM and the multi-stage model presented in the main text of the manuscript is that here, the spatial smooth is constructed using data from the baseline, naval training, and MFAS periods of each SCC.  Therefore, the spatial distribution of MFAS may influence the predicted distribution of Blainville's beaked whales. As expected, using a single GAM leads to underestimates of the impact of sonar, since changes in distribution due to MFAS are not captured by the MRF.
