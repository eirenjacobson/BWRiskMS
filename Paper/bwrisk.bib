	abstract = {Background Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e.g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980–2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark–recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed. Conclusions/Significance Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

Several constraints were imposed on adult and immature survival rates, and several assumptions were made about combinations of age through which immature survival applies (a), age at sexual maturity (m), and maximum age (w). Fecundity was derived by assuming that the population was stationary in 1848 (start of commercial exploitation). Estimates of numbers of animals killed and struck and lost, as well as an assumed mortality rate for whales struck and lost, were used to solve for the 1848 population size assuming that the 1970 level was 4000 bowheads. The 1970 level (4000) was then projected forward to the year 2000 with constant kill regimes for 1983–2000 of 0, 20, and 40 animals per year. Results indicate that there is an apparent incompatibility between the observed proportion of immature whales in the population and the pro...},

	abstract = {Automated methods were developed to detect fin whale calls recorded by an array of ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) deployed off the Portuguese coast between 2007 and 2008. Using recordings collected on a single day in January 2008, a standard seismological method for estimating earthquake location from single instruments, the three-component analysis, was used to estimate the relative azimuth, incidence angle, and horizontal range between each OBS and detected calls. A validation study using airgun shots, performed prior to the call analysis, indicated that the accuracy of the three-component analysis was satisfactory for this preliminary study. Point transect sampling using cue counts, a form of distance sampling, was then used to estimate the average probability of detecting a call via the array during the chosen day. This is a key step to estimating density or abundance of animals using passive acoustic data. The average probability of detection was estimated to be 0.313 (standard error: 0.033). Howev...},

	abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models are now widely used in conservation and management to predict suitable habitat for protected marine species. The primary sources of dynamic habitat data have been in situ and remotely sensed oceanic variables (both are considered “measured data”), but now ocean models can provide historical estimates and forecast predictions of relevant habitat variables such as temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth. To assess the performance of modeled ocean data in species distribution models, we present a case study for cetaceans that compares models based on output from a data assimilative implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to those based on measured data. Specifically, we used seven years of cetacean line-transect survey data collected between 1991 and 2009 to develop predictive habitat-based models of cetacean density for 11 species in the California Current Ecosystem. Two different generalized additive models were compared: one built with a full suite of ROMS output and another built with a full suite of measured data. Model performance was assessed using the percentage of explained deviance, root mean squared error (RMSE), observed to predicted density ratios, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Predicted distribution patterns were similar for models using ROMS output and measured data, and showed good concordance between observed sightings and model predictions. Quantitative measures of predictive ability were also similar between model types, and RMSE values were almost identical. The overall demonstrated success of the ROMS-based models opens new opportunities for dynamic species management and biodiversity monitoring because ROMS output is available in near real time and can be forecast.},

	abstract = {Managing marine species effectively requires spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of their density and distribution. Habitat-based density models, a type of species distribution model (SDM) that uses habitat covariates to estimate species density and distribution patterns, are increasingly used for marine management and conservation because they provide a tool for assessing potential impacts (e.g., from fishery bycatch, ship strikes, anthropogenic sound) over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The abundance and distribution of many pelagic species exhibit substantial seasonal variability, highlighting the importance of predicting density specific to the season of interest. This is particularly true in dynamic regions like the California Current, where significant seasonal shifts in cetacean distribution have been documented at coarse scales. Finer scale (10 km) habitat-based density models were previously developed for many cetacean species occurring in this region, but most models were limited to summer/fall. The objectives of our study were two-fold: 1) develop spatially-explicit density estimates for winter/spring to support management applications, and 2) compare model-predicted density and distribution patterns to previously developed summer/fall model results in the context of species ecology. We used a well-established Generalized Additive Modeling framework to develop cetacean SDMs based on 20 California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) shipboard surveys conducted during winter and spring between 2005 and 2015. Models were fit for short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis delphis), Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Model performance was evaluated based on a variety of established metrics, including the percentage of explained deviance, ratios of observed to predicted density, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Final models were used to produce spatial grids of average species density and spatially-explicit measures of uncertainty. Results provide the first fine scale (10 km) density predictions for these species during the cool seasons and reveal distribution patterns that are markedly different from summer/fall, thus providing novel insights into species ecology and quantitative data for the seasonal assessment of potential anthropogenic impacts.},

	doi = {10.1121/1.1937347},
	abstract = {Recently, automated porpoise-click-detectors (T-PODs, Chelonia-Marine-Research) have been used intensively in monitoring harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in the wild. However, the automated click-detection-mechanism of the T-POD leads to questions on the characteristics of the detection process. We undertook experiments with six captive harbor porpoises (four subadult males in one pool, two adult males in another) at the Dolfinarium Harderwijk (Netherlands). One T-POD was placed for over a week in each pool, while the behavior of the porpoises was logged by visual observation. Data were analyzed using the T-POD software. A total of 725 431 clicks in 30 090 trains were recorded with 32\% of the trains classified as CET HI, 27\% as CET LO, and 41\% as DOUBTFUL. All three train classes differed significantly in all parameters, except for click duration. We conclude that T-PODs perform generally well in detecting click trains of harbor porpoises but that in any future study trains classified as being of lower probability should be investigated very carefully to avoid the risk of losing valuable information.},

	abstract = {Beaked whales are among the most diverse yet least understood groups of marine mammals. A diverse set of mostly anthropogenic threats necessitates improvement in our ability to assess population status for this cryptic group. The Southwest Fisheries Science Center (NOAA) conducted six ship line-transect cetacean abundance surveys in the California Current off the contiguous western United States between 1991 and 2008. We used a Bayesian hidden-process modeling approach to estimate abundance and population trends of beaked whales using sightings data from these surveys. We also compiled records of beaked whale stranding events (3 genera, at least 8 species) on adjacent beaches from 1900 to 2012, to help assess population status of beaked whales in the northern part of the California Current. Bayesian posterior summaries for trend parameters provide strong evidence of declining beaked whale abundance in the study area. The probability of negative trend for Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) during 1991-2008 was 0.84, with 1991 and 2008 estimates of 10771 (CV = 0.51) and ≈7550 (CV = 0.55), respectively. The probability of decline for Mesoplodon spp. (pooled across species) was 0.96, with 1991 and 2008 estimates of 2206 (CV = 0.46) and 811 (CV = 0.65). The mean posterior estimates for average rate of decline were 2.9\% and 7.0\% per year. There was no evidence of abundance trend for Baird's beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), for which annual abundance estimates in the survey area ranged from ≈900 to 1300 (CV≈1.3). Stranding data were consistent with the survey results. Causes of apparent declines are unknown. Direct impacts of fisheries (bycatch) can be ruled out, but impacts of anthropogenic sound (e.g., naval active sonar) and ecosystem change are plausible hypotheses that merit investigation.},

	abstract = {La gestión de las interacciones que se producen entre la flora y fauna y los seres humanos requiere disponer de información fiable acerca de las consecuencias probables que generarán las acciones de gestión. Este requisito es de carácter general, con independencia del grupo taxonómico. En el presente artículo describimos un método para estimar parámetros de dinámica de poblaciones y de toma de decisiones, de aplicación general, extremadamente flexible, que utiliza datos de un modo eficiente y proporciona respuestas en un formato útil. Nuestro ejemplo está relacionado con la captura accidental de una especie protegida, el delfín moteado (Stenella attenuata), en las pesquerías de atún de la costa este del océano Pacífico. Una toma de decisiones bien fundamentada requiere disponer de análisis cuantitativos que tomen en consideración toda la información relevante, permitiendo evaluar cómo afecta la captura accidental a estas especies y cómo afecta la normativa a las pesquerías, además de describir la incertidumbre en los análisis. El análisis bayesiano constituye un marco idóneo para proporcionar información sobre la incertidumbre que acompaña al proceso de toma de decisiones. Además de ser adecuado, permite incluir información acerca de otras poblaciones o especies en los análisis, así como un criterio experto. El análisis integrado pretende incluir en un único proceso todos los datos relevantes de una población, combinando análisis, compartiendo parámetros y estimando el conjunto de dichos parámetros de forma simultánea mediante el empleo de una función objetiva combinada. También garantiza que las presuposiciones del modelo y las estimaciones de parámetros sean coherentes a lo largo de todo el análisis, que la incertidumbre se transmita a través del mismo, y que se mantengan las correlaciones entre los distintos parámetros. Quizá el aspecto más relevante del análisis integrado sea el modo en que permite y obliga a considerar el sistema como un todo, de forma que es posible observar y resolver las posibles contradicciones.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: During recent decades, the 2 distinct harbour porpoise populations of the Baltic Sea have decreased sharply in abundance. The Baltic Proper population is down to a few hundred individuals and is regarded as ‘Critically Endangered’ by IUCN; the more abundant Belt Sea population also appears to have experienced a severe decline. We summarize the results of exten- sive static acoustic monitoring in the German part of the Baltic Sea and compare them to pub- lished results of aerial and acoustic surveys. Acoustic monitoring confirmed seasonal changes in detection rates consistent with proposed east–west migrations. Detection rates, and thus presum- ably porpoise density, decrease from west to east from a long-term mean (2002 to 2012) of 94\% detection-positive days per month (DPD mo−1) around the island of Fehmarn and 71\% DPD mo−1 in Kadet Trench to 4.4\% DPD mo−1 in Pomeranian Bay as one crosses the putative population boundary. Acoustic monitoring results show a recent increase in porpoise registration rates in the Kadet Trench and in Pomeranian Bay, although this does not necessarily indicate a population increase. This large dataset supports the previously suggested proposition that each population uses the boundary waters in Pomeranian Bay alternately, leading to the presence of registration peaks in (late) summer by Belt Sea porpoises, and in winter by Baltic Proper animals. The critical status of porpoises in the Baltic Sea highlights the urgent need for protective measures which still await national and international implementation.},

	url = {http://aquaticcommons.org/id/eprint/9775},
	abstract = {Belugas, Delphinapterus leucas, in Cook Inlet, Alaska, represent a unique and isolated marine mammal population that has been hunted for a variety of purposes since prehistoric times. Archeological studies have shown that both Alutiiq Eskimos and Dena'ina Atabaskan Indians have long utilized many marine resources in Cook Inlet, including belugas. Over the past century, commercial whaling and sport hunting also occurred periodically in Cook Inlet prior to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). During the 1990's, the hunting mortality by Alaska Natives apparently increased to 40-70 whales per year, which led to the decling of this stock and its subsequent designation in 2000 as depleted under the MMPA. Concerns about the decline of the Cook Inlet stock resulted in a voluntary suspension of the subsistenc hunt by Alaska Natives in 1999. The difficulty in obtaining accurate estimates for the harvest of these whales is due to the inability to identify all of the hunters and, in turn, the size of the harvest. Attempts to reconstruct harvest records based on hunters' recollections and interviews from only a few households have been subject to a wide degree of speculation. To adequately monitor the beluga harvest, the National Marine Fisheries Service established marking and reporting regulations in October 1999. These rules require that Alaska Natives who hunt belugas in Cook Inlet must collect the lowere left jaw from harvested whales and complete a report that includes date and time of the harvest, coloration of the whale, harvest location, and method of harvest. The MMPA was amended in 2000 to require a cooperative agreement between the National Marine Fisheries Service and Alaska Native organizations before hunting could be resumed.},

All techniques have limitations and an understanding of how each works and the effect on the signal being analyzed are vital for correct interpretation. The 3 most commonly used techniques for transforming frequencies of a call are heterodyne, frequency division, and time expansion. Three techniques for viewing spectral content of a signal are zero-crossing, Fourier analysis, and instantaneous frequency analysis. It is important for bat researchers to be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each technique.},

Les femelles atteignent leur maturité sexuelle à l'âge de 5 ans, et les mâles à 8 ans. Le béluga peut vivre jusqu'à environ 30 ans. La peau commence à blanchir après la 6ième année.Les bélugas sont caractérisés par des ovulations multiples et des corps jaunes accessoires. L'accouplement a lieu en mai et la mise bas, après une période de gestation de 14.5 mois, d'un seul baleineau a lieu fin de juillet, début d'août. La période de lactation est d'environ 2 ans, d'où un cycle de reproduction de 3 ans. La percée des dents commence à la fin de la 2ième année et n'est pas encore complétée à la fin de la 3ième année. La population sous étude semble avoir été surexploitée commercialement. La productivité de l'espèce est estimée à 43\% de celle implicite dans des études antérieures.},

	abstract = {Le béluga (Delphinapterus leucas) de Cook Inlet est en voie de disparition selon le Loi sur les Espèces en Voie de Disparition des EE.UU. Ses animaux ont le potentiel d’être menacé par des bruits d'origine anthropique et le développement du secteur côtier. Le projet de Réaménagement de Terminal Marine (RTM) du Port de Anchorage, qui aura lieu à Knik Arm de Cook Inlet, Alaska, consiste de plusieurs travaux, comme le dragage, remplissage du gravier et de battage des pieux. Dans cette étude, on a investigué les effets du bruit des travaux sur les vocalises des bélugas. Bouées acoustiques ont été déployées dans un réseau de quatre mouillages pendant 20 jours en Août et Septembre 2009, près du projet RTM. Les données ont été recueillies en temps réel à une station d'observation côtière. Les sifflets ou vocalisations bruyantes des bélugas n’ont pas été enregistrées pendant cette période, mais les clics d'écholocation ont été détectés fréquemment. La somme de l'énergie a été utilisée pour détecter d’une manière automatique des clics d'écholocation. Les temps avec et sans bruit des travaux  (c’est-à le dragage et battage) ont été déterminés par l’examen des spectrogrammes comprimé. Le taux de clic détecté était plus élevé pendant les périodes sans travaux (429 clics détectés / h) qu'avec (291 détecté clics / h), mais la différence n'était pas statistiquement significatif (t (24) = 0,56, P = 0,58). Le vocalises des bélugas de la fréquence basse (par exemple, sifflets) ont été potentiellement masqués, il peut y avoir eu une générale réduction des vocalisations des bélugas, ou il est possible que les bélugas évitaient la domaine pendant l'activité de construction.},

	abstract = {1. Assessments of anthropogenic impacts on cetaceans are often constrained by limited data on the extent to which these species use particular areas.
2. Timing porpoise detectors (T-PODs) are autonomous data recorders for detecting cetacean echolocation clicks, potentially providing cost-effective opportunities for monitoring cetacean occurrence.
3. The performance of T-PODs was assessed in three areas off the Scottish east coast, where the relative occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises was known to differ. Land-based observations in one area compared visual and acoustic detections of dolphins, while direct hydrophone recordings of dolphin echolocation clicks were compared with T-POD detections during boat surveys.
4. Land-based surveys recorded 89 groups of dolphins within 900 m of the T-POD. All groups spending 430 min in the area were detected on the T-POD, and the probability of detection declined in relation to distance from the recording site.
5. The number of dolphin clicks recorded on the independent hydrophone system was significantly related to the number detected by a T-POD. Between pairs of T-PODs, there was also significant correlation with the numbers of clicks recorded in each hour, both for channels set to detect bottlenose dolphins and for channels set to detect harbour porpoises.
6. Year-round deployments of paired T-PODs detected significant geographical variation in detections for both bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises. This pattern reflected published data from visual surveys, where dolphins occurred most regularly within the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation, and porpoises were sighted more regularly in offshore waters.
7. T-PODs do not detect all cetaceans in the area, and care must be taken when interpreting data from mixed species communities. Nevertheless, these results confirm that T-PODs provide an effective method for monitoring the occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises, and provide excellent potential for collecting baseline data from poorly studied areas and monitoring long-term temporal change in key areas of interest.},

	abstract = {Belugas, Delphinapterus leucas, groups were videotaped concurrent to observer counts during annual NMFS aerial surveys of Cook Inlet, Alaska, from 1994 to 2000. The videotapes provided permanent records of whale groups that could be examined and compared to group size estimates ade by aerial observers.Examination of the video recordings resulted in 275 counts of 79 whale groups. The McLaren formula was used to account for whales missed while they were underwater (average correction factor 2.03; SD=0.64). A correction for whales missed due to video resolution was developed by using a second, paired video camera that magnified images relative to the standard video. This analysis showed that some whales were missed either because their image size fell below the resolution of hte standard video recording or because two whales surfaced so close to each other that their images appeared to be one large whale. The correction method that resulted depended on knowing the average whale image size in the videotapes. Image sizes were measured for 2,775 whales from 275 different passes over whale groups. Corrected group sizes were calcualted as the product of the original count from video, the correction factor for whales missed underwater, and the correction factor for whales missed due to video resolution (averaged 1.17; SD=0.06). A regression formula was developed to estimate group sizes from aerial observer counts; independent variables were the aerial counts and an interaction term relative to encounter rate (whales per second during the counting of a group), which were regressed against the respective group sizes as calculated from the videotapes. Significant effects of encounter rate, either positive or negative, were found for several observers. This formula was used to estimate group size when video was not available. The estimated group sizes were used in the annual abundance estimates.},

	abstract = {While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4-150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation ({\textgreater}30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35-45 dB) were identified in the range 45-80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.},

	url = {http://aquaticcommons.org/id/eprint/9773},
	abstract = {Suction-cup-attached VHF radio transmittes were deployed on belugas, Delphinapterus leucas, in Cook Inlet, Alaska, in 1994 and 1995 to characterize the whales' surfacing behavior. Data from video recordings were also used to characterize behavior of undisturbed whales and whales actively pursued for tagging. Statistics for dive intervals (time between the midpoints of contiguous surfacings) and surfacing intevals (time at the surface per surfacing) were estimated. Operations took place on the tidal delta of the Susitna and Little Susitna Rivers. During the 2-yr study, eight whales were successfully tagged, five tags remained attached for {\textgreater}60 min, and data from these were used in the analyses. Mean dive interval was 24.1 sec (interwhale SD=6.4 sec, n=5). The mean surfacing interval, as determined from the duration of signals received from the radio transmitters, was 1.8 sec (SD=0.3 sec, n=125) for one of the whales. Videotaped behaviors were categorized as "head-lifts" or "slow-rolls." Belugas were more likely to head-lift than to slow-roll during vessel approaches and tagging attempts when compared to undisturbed whales. In undisturbed groups, surfacing intervals determined from video records were significantly different between head-lifting (average = 1.02 sect, SD=0.38 sed, n=28) and slow-rolling whales (average = 2.45 sec, SD=0.37 sec, n=106). Undisturbed juveniles exhibited shorter slow-roll surfacing intervals (average = 2.25 sec, SD=0.32 sec, n=36) than adults (average = 2.55 sec, SD=0.36 sec, n=70). We did not observe strong reactions by the belugas to the suction-cup tags. This tagging method shows promise for obtaining surfacing data for durations of several days.},

We conducted systematic aerial line-transect surveys (17 237 km total effort) for harbor porpoises, with the goal of estimating density and abundance in the inland waters of Washington State. Surveys in Puget Sound occurred throughout the year from 2013 to 2015, and in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the San Juan Islands (and some adjacent Canadian waters) in April 2015. We used a high-wing, twin-engine Partenavia airplane and four observers (one on each side of the plane, one looking through a belly port, and one recording data). A total of 1063 harbor porpoise groups were sighted. Density and abundance were estimated using conventional distance sampling methods. Analyses were limited to 447 harbor porpoise groups observed during 5708 km of effort during good sighting conditions suitable for line-transect analysis. Harbor porpoises occurred in all regio...},

	abstract = {The harbour seal population in Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland, has reduced by 65\% between 2001 and 2010. The cause(s) of this decline are unknown but must affect the demographic parameters of the population. Here, satellite telemetry data were used to test the hypothesis that increased pup mortality could be a primary driver of the decline in Orkney. Pup mortality and tag failure parameters were estimated from the duration of operation of satellite tags deployed on harbour seal pups from the Orkney population (n = 24) and from another population on the west coast of Scotland (n = 24) where abundance was stable. Survival probabilities from both populations were best represented by a common gamma distribution and were not different from one another, suggesting that increased pup mortality is unlikely to be the primary agent in the Orkney population decline. The estimated probability of surviving to 6 months was 0.390 (95\% CI 0.297 – 0.648) and tag failure was represented by a Gaussian distribution, with estimated mean 270 (95\% CI = 198 – 288) and s.d. 21 (95\% CI = 1 – 66) days. These results suggest that adult survival is the most likely proximate cause of the decline. They also demonstrate a novel technique for attaining age-specific mortality rates from telemetry data.},

	abstract = {1. Modelling of the population dynamics of seals require data on an array of vital parameters (fecundity, mortality, age structure, migrations, population growth rate). The most common way to obtain these data is to estimate the parameters from samples taken from the population. However, the influence from skewed samples can be substantial in populations with age- and sex-specific features. By quantifying the behavioural differences among age and sex classes, data from skewed samples can be compensated retrospectively. Awareness of the existence and the potential magnitude of such biases is highly relevant for the design of surveys, sampling programmes and the implementation of management plans of age structured populations. 2. The age- and sex-specific behaviour of harbour seals Phoca vitulina and grey seals Halichoerus grypus can be studied by using freeze-branded animals. Since the brand is permanent and visible up to a distance of 500 m, the harassment is limited to one occasion in the lifetime of the seal (the catching day). 3. A method is also given for analysing data arising from re-sighted branded animals, where re-sightings of individual seals were transformed to estimates of relative haul-out frequencies of seals by age and sex. 4. The composition of harbour seal groups on land exhibit a conspicuous seasonal flux, and the fraction on land was not representative of the entire population at any time during the summer. The results have far-reaching implications since most studies of seals are carried out at haul-out sites, and differential behaviour between the sexes and among age classes is expected in all populations and species of seals. Skewed samples generate biases in estimates of population growth rate, age-specific mortality and fecundity. 5. Age-specific haul-out patterns must be taken into account when analysing data from populations with non-stable age structures. As a consequence of changes in age structure after the 1988 seal epizootic, surveys under-estimated the size of the Swedish–Danish harbour seal population by 6\% in 1988 and over-estimated the same parameter by up to 16\% during the following years. 6. The present paper establishes the complications of sampling natural populations that are structured by age and sex, and presents a method on how to quantify sampling errors.},

Generalized linear models with negative binomial errors were used to represent these overdispersed data. The shape parameter of the negative binomial distribution was directly estimated from the data where this was possible. Information from time-series of counts where there were few gaps in the data was used to improve the estimation of this parameter in areas where fewer surveys had been carried out. The results show that the number of harbour seals in eastern England has not increased since the end of the 2002 phocine distemper epidemic. There is also evidence of a general decline in most of the large harbour seal colonies around Britain. The populations in the Inner Hebrides were an exception, with numbers appearing to be stable or increasing. Between 2001 and 2006, the population in Orkney and Shetland declined by 40\% (95\% confidence interval: 30–50\%), indicating harbour seals in these areas experienced substantially increased mortality or very low recruitment over this period. The widespread declines, ranging from Shetland to The Wash, suggest that the causes may have been present over a large part of the North Sea.},

Domoic acid (DA) is a biotoxin produced by the Pseudo-nitzschia group of diatoms many of which are now a common component of the Scottish phytoplankton community (Stobo et al., 2008). DA is a potent excitatory neurotoxin that has caused large-scale mortality of marine mammals. We found harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in Scotland are exposed to DA. Low levels, likely from recent exposure, were measured in the faeces and urine of live captured adult animals (using a direct competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and exposure was highest during August–September 2008 (7/32 of the faecal (22\%) and 11/29 (38\%) of the urine samples were positive). Median concentrations in positive faeces and urine were 25ng/g and 6ng/ml respectively. One positive pregnant female was subsequently found dead with 10ng/ml DA in her amniotic fluid but the contribution of DA exposure to the cause of death could not be established. However, the highest levels in the study were found in anonymous faecal samples collected in September 2009 on the east coast of Scotland (up to 397ng/g). Further studies are urgently needed to determine the importance of DA exposure to the population dynamics of Scottish harbour seals in light of the recently reported major population declines.},

They are important for understanding both the current situation of species and potential risks to them. This study presents estimates of the size of the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population associated with the Orkney Islands, a part of northern Scotland that used to contain one of the largest concentrations of this species in Europe. The numbers of animals counted during aerial surveys of this area have decreased substantially over the period 2001–2010. ARGOS transmitters attached to flipper tags were used to rescale the counts into estimates of abundance and to confirm the rate of decline of this population. Females hauled out for more of the survey window (0.84; bootstrap 95\% CI: 0.63–0.99) than males (0.61; bootstrap 95\% CI: 0.34–0.86). The animals hauled out less during weekends (0.57; bootstrap 95\% CI: 0.40–0.74) than during the week (0.76; bootstrap 95\% CI: 0.58–0.91). The sex-ratios of this population is unknown. Assuming it was close to 1:1, then there were around 3586 (bootstrap 95\% CI: 2970–4542) harbour seals in Orkney in 2010. A female-skewed sex-ratio would reduce the population estimate, and a changing sex-ratio might mean the counts understate the real decline. The mean annual rate of decline in the Orkney population of harbour seals, over the period 2001–2010, is estimated at 13\% (95\% CI: 10.8–14.8). Similar data for Arisaig, on the west coast of Scotland, shows an increase of around 2\% (95\% CI: 1.5–2.4) and, assuming an equal sex-ratio, 923 animals (95\% CI: 765–1169) in 2007.

Multi-type mark–recapture statistics were applied to individual re-sighting histories of branded seals, and survival probability was estimated with weight as a covariate. The probability of surviving to an age of 1 year is only 0·63 for the smallest pups at 17 kg, whereas pups at 32 kg have a survival probability of 0·96. 2 An energetic model for juvenile Harbour Seals reveals how metabolic rate is related to body mass, skin surface area, blubber thickness and water temperature. There is an increasing thermal stress with decreasing body size of pups. Low winter water temperatures induce a negative energy balance in small pups, which is a probable cause of the observed mass-dependent survival. 3 This study explicitly links a physical property of the environment, sea-water temperature, to energetics and life history. The approach opens possibilities for studying aspects of life-history evolution, such as optimal weaning weight and pupping time, in marine mammals.},

	abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This article provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).

Existing methods are mostly based on regression, which limits their utility when there are multiple hypotheses to consider and the data are sparse and noisy. Our likelihood-based approach is unbiased with regard to sample size, and its posterior probability landscape allows for the separate consideration of magnitude and certainty for multiple factors simultaneously. As applied to Steller sea lions, the approach uses a stochastic population model in which the vital rates (fecundity, pup survival, non-pup survival) at a particular rookery in each year are functions of one or more local conditions (total prey availability, species composition of available prey, ﬁsheries activity, predation risk indices). Three vital rates and four scaling functions produce twelve nonexclusive hypotheses, of which we considered 10; we assumed a priori that fecundity would not be affected by ﬁshery activities or predation. The likelihood of all the rookery- and year-speciﬁc census data was calculated by averaging across sample paths, using backward iteration and a beta-binomial structure for observation error. We computed the joint maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of parameters associated with each hypothesis and constructed marginal likelihood curves to examine the support for each effect. We found strong support for a positive effect of total prey availability on pup recruitment, negative effects of prey species composition (pollock fraction) on fecundity and pup survival, and a positive effect of harbor seal density (our inverse proxy for predation risk) on non-pup survival. These results suggest a natural framework for adaptive management; for example, the areas around some of the rookeries could be designated as experimental zones where ﬁshery quotas are contingent upon the results of preﬁshing season survey trawls. We contrast our results with those of previous studies, demonstrating the importance of testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously and quantitatively when investigating the causes of a population decline.},

	abstract = {Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) increased in the eastern portion of their range while declining in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands from the late 1970s to late 1990s. We constructed ecosystem models of the central and western Aleutians and of southeast Alaska to simultaneously evaluate four hypotheses explaining sea lion dynamics: killer whale (Orcinus orca) predation, ocean productivity, fisheries, and competition with other species. Comparisons of model predictions with historical time series data indicate that all four factors likely contributed to the trends observed in sea lion numbers in both ecosystems. Changes in ocean productivity conveyed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation influenced the abundance trajectory of several species. Fishing could have affected the ecosystem structure by influencing the abundance of Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) in the Aleutians and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in southeast Alaska. Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) in the Aleutians and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in southeast Alaska appear to impede sea lion population growth through competitive interactions. Predation by killer whales was important when sea lions were less abundant in the 1990s in the Aleutians and in the 1960s in Southeast Alaska, but appear to have little effect when sea lion numbers were high.},

	abstract = {The timing and extent of the negative population trend in the abundance of the western stock of Steller sea lions has not been geographically uniform. A stochastic metapopulation dynamics model is developed for Steller sea lions. This model allows for geographical differences in factors affecting population processes, and can be parameterized to represent a wide range of hypotheses for the decline in Steller sea lion abundance. Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods are used to fit this model to pup and non-pup count data, age structure samples, and survival estimates. Inferences from model selection criteria highlight the spatial variability in the types of impact deemed to provide most parsimonious representation of the data. Bayesian posteriors for the estimated model parameters show that many combinations of parameter values are able to provide similar fits to the data, even given a specific hypothesis for the decline. This highlights the uncertainty in the precise nature of the impact of these hypotheses. Indeed, while pup production is generally estimated consistently among models, estimates of the size of other components of the Steller sea lion population (such as total population size) depend greatly on the assumptions regarding the cause of the decline. The results demonstrate that future simulation modeling approaches will require more formal, spatial, and mechanistic descriptions of the manner in which specific hypotheses for the decline affect the population.},

As a result, the drivers underlying the variable trends in abundance exhibited by harbor seal populations around the world remain uncertain. We developed an individual-based study of harbor seals in northeast Scotland, whereby data were collected during daily photo-identiﬁcation surveys throughout the pupping seasons between 2006 and 2011. However, a consequence of observing seals remotely meant that information on sex, maturity-stage, or breeding status was not always available. To provide unbiased estimates of survival rates we conditioned initial release of individuals on the ﬁrst time sex was known to estimate sex-speciﬁc survival rates, while a robust design multistate model accounting for uncertainty in breeding status was used to estimate reproductive rate of multiparous and ≥3-yr-old females. Survival rates were estimated at 0.95 (95\% CI = 0.91–0.97) for females and 0.92 (0.83–0.96) for males, while reproductive rate was estimated at 0.89 (0.75–0.95) for multiparous and 0.69 (0.64–0.74) for ≥3-yr-old females. Stage-based population modeling indicated that this population should be recovering, even under the current shooting quotas implemented by the recent management plan.},

	abstract = {Behavioural differences among population segments coupled with the transient dynamics of perturbed population structures lead to severely biased estimates of the intrinsic rates of increase in natural populations. This phenomenon is expected to occur in most populations that are structured by age, sex, state, or rank. The 1988 epizootic in European harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) perturbed the population composition radically. Detailed documentation of mass mortality, 20 years of population surveys, and data on age- and sex-specific behaviour were used to quantify biases in the observed rate of increase (λ obs.), which in many areas substantially exceeded the “maximum rate of increase”. This is serious, since λ obs. is a key parameter, for example, in estimating potential biological removal or modelling population dynamics. For populations where the underlying age and sex composition is unknown, we suggest that data on fecundity and survival rates be used to find the upper theoretical rate of population increase. We found that the intrinsic rates of increase (λ1) in populations of true seals with even sex ratios and stable age structures cannot exceed 13\% per year (λ1max. = 1.13). Frequently reported larger values are indicative of nonstable population structures or populations affected by migrations.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is used for many vocal species. However, few studies have quantified the fraction of vocalisations captured, and how animal distance and sound source level affect detection probability. Quantifying the detection probability or effective detection area (EDA) of a recorder is a prerequisite for designing and implementing monitoring studies, and essential for estimating absolute density and abundance from PAM data. We tested the detector performance of cetacean click loggers (C-PODs) using artificial and recorded harbour porpoise clicks played at a range of distances and source levels. Detection rate of individual clicks and click sequences (or click trains) was calculated. A Generalised Additive Model (GAM) was used to create a detection function and estimate the effective detection radius (EDR) and EDA for both types of signals. Source level and distance from logger influenced the detection probability. Whilst differences between loggers were evident, detectability was influenced more by the deployment site than within-logger variability. Maximum distance for detecting real recorded porpoise clicks was 566 m. Mean EDR for artificial signals with source level 176 dB re 1 μPa @ 1m was 187 m., and for a recorded vocalisation with source level up to 182 dB re 1 μPa was 188 m. For detections classified as harbour porpoise click sequences the mean EDR was 72 m. The analytical methods presented are a valid technique for estimating the EDA of any logger used in abundance estimates. We present a practical way to obtain data with a cetacean click logger, with the caveat that artificial playbacks cannot mimic real animal behaviour and are at best able to account for some of the variability in detections between sites, removing logger and propagation effects so that what remains is density and behavioural differences. If calibrated against real-world EDAs (e.g., from tagged animals) it is possible to estimate site-specific detection area and absolute density. We highlight the importance of accounting for both biological and environmental factors affecting vocalisations so that accurate estimates of detection area can be determined, and effective monitoring regimes implemented.},

	abstract = {Changes in the abundance and distribution of wildlife populations are common consequences of historic and contemporary climate change. Some Arctic marine mammals, such as the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), may be particularly vulnerable to such changes due to the loss of Arctic sea ice. We evaluated the impacts of environmental variation on demographic rates for the Western Hudson Bay (WH), polar bear subpopulation from 1984 to 2011 using live-­recapture and dead-r­ecovery data in a Bayesian implementation of multistate capture–recapture models. We found that survival of female polar bears was related to the annual timing of sea ice break-u­ p and formation. Using estimated vital rates (e.g., survival and reproduction) in matrix projection models, we calculated the growth rate of the WH subpopulation and projected population responses under different environmental scenarios while accounting for parametric uncertainty, temporal variation, and demographic stochasticity. Our analysis suggested a long-t­erm decline in the number of bears from 1185 (95\% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] = 993–1411) in 1987 to 806 (95\% BCI = 653–984) in 2011. In the last 10 yr of the study, the number of bears appeared stable due to temporary stability in sea ice conditions (mean population growth rate for the period 2001–2010 = 1.02, 95\% BCI = 0.98–1.06). Looking forward, we estimated long-­ term growth rates for the WH subpopulation of {\textasciitilde}1.02 (95\% BCI = 1.00–1.05) and 0.97 (95\% BCI = 0.92–1.01) under hypothetical high and low sea ice conditions, respectively. Our findings support previous evidence for a demographic linkage between sea ice conditions and polar bear population dynamics. Furthermore, we present a robust framework for sensitivity analysis with respect to continued climate change (e.g., to inform scenario planning) and for evaluating the combined effects of climate change and management actions on the status of wildlife populations.},

Effective monitoring should be easily repeatable while capturing spatio-temporal variation. Mobile acoustic driving transect surveys (‘mobile transects’) have been touted as a robust, cost-effective method to monitor bats; however, it is not clear how well mobile transects represent dynamic bat communities, especially when used as the sole survey approach. To assist biologists who must select a single survey method due to resource limitations, we assessed the effectiveness of three acoustic survey methods at detecting species richness in a vast protected area (Everglades National Park): (1) mobile transects, (2) stationary surveys that were strategically located by sources of open water and (3) stationary surveys that were replicated spatially across the landscape. We found that mobile transects underrepresented bat species richness compared to stationary surveys across all major vegetation communities and in two distinct seasons (dry/cool and wet/warm). Most critically, mobile transects failed to detect three rare bat species, one of which is federally endangered. Spatially replicated stationary surveys did not estimate higher species richness than strategically located stationary surveys, but increased the rate at which species were detected in one vegetation community. The survey strategy that detected maximum species richness and the highest mean nightly species richness with minimal effort was a strategically located stationary detector in each of two major vegetation communities during the wet/warm season.},

Each section assesses the principles behind using the respective technology and provides recent examples of research and management applications for marine mammals and fish. The section on archival sensors highlights the need for continued development of automated acoustic detectors to assess large data sets. Case studies are presented of detectors developed for determining seasonal occurrence and distribution of haddock sounds and humpback whale vocalizations. Also presented are studies of other applications using archival sensors: tracking singing humpback whales in Brazil, using vocalizations to assess the reproductive strategies of Arctic bearded seals and assessing regional variability in call patterns for North Atlantic right whales. The section on real-time passive acoustic sensors focuses on real-time buoys and towed arrays. Case studies presented include a real-time buoy system used for monitoring endangered North Atlantic right whales and a stationary autonomous array providing real-time access to Antarctic acoustic data. The value of using towed arrays for real-time applications is also assessed, and a case study is provided on the use of towed arrays to improve abundance estimates of North Pacific cetaceans and to better understand vocalization behaviors.},

Although IPMs have been used in population ecology and ﬁsheries management, their use in wildlife management has been limited. Data sets available for North American waterfowl are unprecedented in terms of time span ({\textgreater}60 years) and geographic coverage, and are especially well-suited for development of IPMs that could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide future harvest and habitat management decisions. In this overview, we illustrate 3 potential beneﬁts of IPMs: integration of multiple data sources (i.e., population counts, markrecapture data, and fecundity estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a historical study of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). Drawing from our own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how IPMs could be used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest inﬂuence on population change in lesser scaup (Aythya afﬁnis), evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for American black ducks (Anas rubripes), or prioritize the most appropriate places to conduct habitat management to beneﬁt northern pintails (Anas acuta). Integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help managers make ecologically based decisions.

	abstract = {Assessing the strength of density dependence is crucial for understanding population dynamics, but its estimation is difﬁcult. Because estimates of population size and demographic parameters usually include errors due to imperfect detection, estimations of the strength of density dependence will be biased if obtained with conventional methods and lack statistical power to detect density dependence. We propose a Bayesian integrated population model to study density dependence. The model allows assessing the effect of density both on the population growth rate as well as the demographic parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. We studied the performance of this model using simulation and illustrate its use with data on red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio. Our simulation results showed that the strength of density dependence is identiﬁable and it was estimated with higher precision using the integrated population model than the conventional regression model. As expected, the conventional regression model tended to overestimate density dependence at the population level whereas underestimates at the demographic level, but the bias was small. The analysis of the red-backed shrike data revealed negative density dependence at the population level most likely mediated by a density-dependent decline in adult survival. This work highlights the potential of integrated population models in assessing density dependence and its practical application in population studies.},

Estimates of annual apparent survival (1 À (mortality þ emigration)) of females were from 0.05 to 0.10 higher than those of males and were 0.820 for weaning ({\textasciitilde}1 month) to 1 year, 0.865 for 1–3 years, and 0.929 at 3–7 years. Annual survival of males was 0.717, 0.782, and 0.879 for the same ages. Highest mortality occurred preweaning, with cumulative mortality to 4 weeks of age of 0.259, indicating this is the most vulnerable period for Tugidak harbor seals. Estimates of survival, not biased by misidentiﬁcation, required that an individual had at least 2 good-quality, matching photographs in the photograph library. The number of photographs available for matching improved resighting probabilities from 0.43 for seals with 2 photographs to 0.69 for seals with 8 photographs, but this heterogeneity did not affect survival estimates. Survival estimates based on photograph-identiﬁcation data were nearly identical to those based on resightings of ﬂipper-tagged seals using mark–recapture models with a preliminary double-tag–loss estimate of 2.5\% per year. Photograph identiﬁcation of natural pelage markings provides a viable method for estimating vital rates of harbor seals even at large haul-outs (.1,000 animals) and may be useful for populations of conservation concern that require low disturbance of animals or where capturing sufﬁcient numbers of seals for artiﬁcial marking is not feasible.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting suﬃcient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difﬁculties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the eﬀects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, sourcesink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density eﬀects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and reﬁned management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

The population size is thought to be less than 1,000 individuals; these animals reside principally within a national park on Prins Karls Forland on the west coast of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, at about 78°20¢N. The material presented in this study was collected from 367 livecaptured animals, aged based on growth layers read from stained, decalciﬁed incisor sections (except for pups of the year). Standard length (F1,246=45.70, P{\textless}0.0001) and body mass (F1,258=25.28; P{\textless}0.0001) were both signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by sex when age was taken into account. Adult males are both longer [152.9±4.8 (SE) vs 140.1±2.0 cm, standard length] and heavier (104.0±5.0 vs 83.2±2.7 kg, body mass) than adult females in this population. Age at sexual maturity was assessed based on analyses of sex hormones. Testosterone levels in males showed an abrupt increase at 6 years of age, while estradiol levels in females increased from age 4. The reproductive rate of adult females was 0.93. The longevity of Svalbard harbour seals was short compared to harbour-seal populations from other areas. However, these seals are not exposed to terrestrial predation; there is no known mortality due to ﬁsheries or hunting and their pollution burdens are low. Extreme seasonality and perhaps other harsh environmental conditions at the northern edge of this species’ distribution may exert long-term low levels of stress that result in short life span, or there are currently unknown acute sources of mortality in this population. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study of population parameters on a pinniped species using cross-sectional, nonterminal sampling.},

	abstract = {Survival rates have rarely been estimated for pinniped populations due to the constraints of obtaining unbiased sample data. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating survival probabilities from individual recognition data in the form of photographic documentation of pelage patterns. This method was applied to estimate adult (age 2+) survival for harbour seals in the Moray Firth, NE Scotland. An astronomical telescope was used to obtain digital images of individual seals, and high-quality images were used to document the annual presence or absence of individuals at a single haul-out site over a 4-year period. A total of 95 females, 10 males and 57 individuals of unknown sex were photographically documented during the study period. Survival and recapture probabilities were estimated using Jolly–Seber mark–recapture models in a Bayesian statistical framework. Computer-intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the probability distributions for the survival and recapture probabilities, conveying the full extent of the uncertainty resulting from unavoidably sparse observational data. The deviance information criterion was used to identify a best-ﬁtting model that accounted for variation in the probability of capture between sexes, with constant survival. The model estimated adult survival as 0.98 (95\% probability interval of 0.94–1.00) using our photo-identiﬁcation data alone, and 0.97 (0.92–0.99) with the use of an informative prior distribution based on previously published estimates of harbour seal survival. This paper represents the ﬁrst survival estimate for harbour seals in the UK, and the ﬁrst survival estimate using photo-identiﬁcation data in any species of pinniped.},

	abstract = {The mortality as a result of the 1988 virus epizootic amongst harbour seals Phoca vitulina in the North and Baltic Seas is estimated at 60\% in the entire Wadden Sea. In the years 1989-1994, a prosperous recovery of the population has been observed which is reflected in a high post-epizootic rate of increase. The average annual rate of increase for the entire area was 16\%, highest in The Netherlands (average 21\%) and lowest in Denmark (average 10\%). This rate of increase is significantly higher than in the pre-epizootic period 1976-1987, when the population increased at a rate of around 9\% per year. The difference is partly attributed to a considerably lower initial juvenile mortality after the epizootic. The present first-year mortality is statistically significantly lower than in the 1970s. It is about equal in all regions and estimated at approximately 40\%, whereas it was approximately 65\% in the 1970s. The post-epizootic reproductive rate in The Netherlands is significantly higher: 21\% on average, against 13\% before 1988; it is also higher in Niedersachsen (21 vs. 16\%), but lower in Schleswig-Holstein (19 vs. 23\%), while in Denmark it has not changed (both 17\%). It is hypothesised that the improved reproductive rate in The Netherlands might be a result of selective mortality during the epidemic, which within the adult female segment would have predominantly affected those not reproducing. It is emphasised that though the population is recovering well, its size of almost 8800 animals in 1994 is still only one quarter of an estimated reference figure of 37000 seals around 1900. How long the recovery will continue at its present rate depends on environmental conditions in the area, such as pollution, disturbance and food resources; nor can a recurrent flickering of the epidemic be excluded.},

	abstract = {1. The dynamics of many populations is strongly affected by immigrants. However, estimating and modelling immigration is a real challenge. In the past, several methods have been developed to estimate immigration rate but they either require strong assumptions or combine in a piecewise manner the results from separate analyses. In most methods the effects of covariates cannot be modelled formally. 2. We developed a Bayesian integrated population model which combines capture–recapture data, population counts and information on reproductive success into a single model that estimates and models immigration rate, while directly assessing the impact of environmental covariates. 3. We assessed parameter identifiability by comparing posterior distributions of immigration rates under varying priors, and illustrated the application of the model with long term demographic data of a little owl Athene noctua population from Southern Germany. We further assessed the impact of environmental covariates on immigration. 4. The resulting posterior distributions were insensitive to different prior distributions and dominated by the observed data, indicating that the immigration rate was identifiable. Average yearly immigration into the little owl population was 0·293 (95\% credible interval 0·183–0·418), which means that ca 0·3 female per resident female entered the population every year. Immigration rate tended to increase with increasing abundance of voles, the main prey of little owls. 5. Synthesis and applications. The means to estimate and model immigration is an important step towards a better understanding of the dynamics of geographically open populations. The demographic estimates obtained from the developed integrated population model facilitate population diagnoses and can be used to assess population viability. The structural flexibility of the model should constitute a useful tool for wildlife managers and conservation ecologists.},

To quantify the conservation requirements of these species we need robust estimates of the impact of each threat on the rate of population decline. However, for the vast majority of species this information is lacking. Here we demonstrate the application of integrated population modelling as a means of deriving robust estimates of the impact of multiple threats for a rapidly declining koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) population in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Integrated population modelling provides a basis for reducing uncertainty and bias by formally integrating information from multiple data sources into a single model. We quantify mortality rates due to threats from dog attacks, vehicle collisions and disease and the extent to which each of these mortality rates would need to be reduced, or how much habitat would need to be restored, to stop the population declining. We show that the integrated population modelling approach substantially reduces uncertainty. We also show that recovery actions that only address single threats would need to reduce those threats to implausibly low levels to recover the population. This indicates that strategies for simultaneously tackling multiple threats are necessary; a situation that is likely to be true for many of the world’s threatened species. This study provides an important framework for quantifying the conservation requirements of species undergoing declines due to multiple threats.},

	abstract = {Using only spatially and temporally replicated point counts, Royle (2004b, Biometrics 60, 108–115) developed an N -mixture model to estimate the abundance of an animal population when individual animal detection probability is unknown. One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been veriﬁed solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical veriﬁcation was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the N -mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original N -mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The ﬁrst example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.},

	abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abundances that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework. The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method as the “numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method” and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods. We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Ricker parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting models and data and ecology.},

WLD claim that these models are difficult to fit and argue that disregarding detectability can be better than trying to adjust for it. We think that this conclusion and subsequent recommendations are not well founded and may negatively impact the quality of statistical inference in ecology and related management decisions. Here we respond to WLD’s claims, evaluating in detail their arguments, using simulations and/or theory to support our points. In particular, WLD argue that both disregarding and accounting for imperfect detection lead to the same estimator performance regardless of sample size when detectability is a function of abundance. We show that this, the key result of their paper, only holds for cases of extreme heterogeneity like the single scenario they considered. Our results illustrate the dangers of disregarding imperfect detection. When ignored, occupancy and detection are confounded: the same na¨ıve occupancy estimates can be obtained for very different true levels of occupancy so the size of the bias is unknowable. Hierarchical occupancy models separate occupancy and detection, and imprecise estimates simply indicate that more data are required for robust inference about the system in question. As for any statistical method, when underlying assumptions of simple hierarchical models are violated, their reliability is reduced. Resorting in those instances where hierarchical occupancy models do no perform well to the na¨ıve occupancy estimator does not provide a satisfactory solution. The aim should instead be to achieve better estimation, by minimizing the effect of these issues during design, data collection and analysis, ensuring that the right amount of data is collected and model assumptions are met, considering model extensions where appropriate.},

	abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly ﬁnd that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different ﬁelds. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it speciﬁcally for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

Our modeling framework can be used to make reliable inferences on abundance as well as recruitment, immigration, stage-speciﬁc survival, and detection rates during sampling. We present a range of simulations to illustrate the data requirements, including the number of years and locations necessary for accurate and precise parameter estimates. We apply our modeling framework to a population of northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus) in the mid-Atlantic region (USA) and ﬁnd that the population is unexpectedly declining. Our approach represents a valuable advance in the estimation of population dynamics using multistate data from unmarked individuals and should additionally be useful in the development of integrated models that combine data from intensive (e.g., mark–recapture) and extensive (e.g., counts) data sources.

Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g., camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to revolutionize the study of animal population ecology.},

Two sympatric marine predators, grey seals Halichoerus grypus and harbour seals Phoca vitulina, have overlapping ranges on land and at sea but contrasting population dynamics around Britain: whilst grey seals have generally increased, harbour seals have shown significant regional declines. We analysed 2 decades of atsea movement data and terrestrial count data from these species to produce high resolution, broad-scale maps of distribution and associated uncertainty to inform conservation and management. Our results showed that grey seals use offshore areas connected to their haul-out sites by prominent corridors, and harbour seals primarily stay within 50 km of the coastline. Both species show fine-scale offshore spatial segregation off the east coast of Britain and broad-scale partitioning off western Scotland. These results illustrate that, for broad-scale marine spatial planning, the conservation needs of harbour seals (primarily inshore, the exception being selected offshore usage areas) are different from those of grey seals (up to 100 km offshore and corridors connecting these areas to haul-out sites). More generally, our results illustrate the importance of detailed knowledge of marine predator distributions to inform marine spatial planning; for instance, spatial prioritisation is not necessarily the most effective spatial planning strategy even when conserving species with similar taxonomy.},

	abstract = {Models of population dynamics are frequently used for purposes such as testing hypotheses about density dependence and predicting species' responses to future environmental change or conservation actions. Fitting models of population dynamics to field data is challenging because most data sets are characterized by observation error, which can inflate estimates of process variation if ignored. Recently, state-space models have been developed to deal with this problem by directly modeling both the observation error and the ecological process of interest. Conventional state-space models, however, have several important limitations: (1) they assume that random effects are Gaussian distributed, which implies that abundance can be negative and that false positive observation errors are equally likely as false negative errors; (2) they do not admit spatial variation in population dynamics; and (3) some of the parameters of the model are not estimable. We demonstrate how each of these problems can be resolved using a class of hierarchical models proposed by Dail and Madsen (2011) that attributes observation error to imperfect detection. We expand this class of models to accommodate classical growth models (e.g., exponential and Ricker-logistic), zero-inflation, and random effects. We also present methods for forecasting population size under future environmental conditions. Implementation of these ideas is possible using either frequentist or Bayesian methods, as demonstrated by accompanying R and JAGS code. Results of a simulation study suggest that bias is negligible and coverage nominal in most cases for the proposed model extensions. An analysis of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey highlights how these methods can be readily applied to existing data, but it also suggests that precision will be low when direct information about detection probability (such as is collected using distance sampling or replicated counts) is lacking.},

The framework is based on the principles of behavioural aggregation where a facilitator-guided group interact and share information to arrive at a consensus. It was originally designed for helping to elicit judgements about single uncertain variables, but, in recent years, the framework and the associated software implementations have been extended to accommodate judgements about more complex multidimensional variables and geographically-dispersed experts. In this chapter, we discuss the aims and foundations of the framework, its extensions and its notable applications.},

Wolves are known to avoid people and wolf attacks on humans are very rare worldwide. However, the subjectively perceived threat is considerable, especially as food-conditioned habituation to humans occurs sporadically. Lower Saxony (Germany) has an exceedingly higher human population density than most other regions with territorial wolves; thus, the potential for human–wolf conﬂicts is higher. Using hunters’ wildlife survey data from 455 municipalities and two years (2014–2015) and data from the ofﬁcial wolf monitoring (557 conﬁrmed wolf presences and 500 background points) collected between 2012–2015, grey wolf habitat selection was modelled using generalized additive models with respect to human population density, road density, forest cover and roe deer density. Moreover, we tested whether habitat use changed in response to human population and road density between 2012/2013 and 2014/2015.},

	abstract = {We classiﬁed land cover types from 1940s historical aerial imagery using Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and compared these maps with data on recent cover. Few studies have used these kinds of maps to model drivers of cover change, partly due to two statistical challenges: 1) appropriately accounting for spatial autocorrelation and 2) appropriately modeling percent cover which is bounded between 0 and 100 and not normally distributed. We studied the change in woody cover at four sites in California's North Coast using historical (1948) and recent (2009) high spatial resolution imagery. We classiﬁed the imagery using eCognition Developer and aggregated the resulting maps to the scale of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in order to understand topographic drivers of woody cover change. We used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with a quasi-binomial probability distribution to account for spatial autocorrelation and the boundedness of the percent woody cover variable. We explored the relative inﬂuences on current percent woody cover of topographic variables (grouped using principal component analysis) reﬂecting water retention capacity, exposure, and within-site context, as well as historical percent woody cover and geographical coordinates. We estimated these models for pixel sizes of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 m, reﬂecting both tree neighborhood scales and stand scales. We found that historical woody cover had a consistent positive effect on current woody cover, and that the spatial autoregressive term in the model was signiﬁcant even after controlling for historical cover. Speciﬁc topographic variables emerged as important for different sites at different scales, but no overall pattern emerged across sites or scales for any of the topographic variables we tested. This GAM framework for modeling historical data is ﬂexible and could be used with more variables, more ﬂexible relationships with predictor variables, and larger scales. Modeling drivers of woody cover change from historical ecology data sources can be a valuable way to plan restoration and enhance ecological insight into landscape change.},

	abstract = {The thermal suitability of riverine habitats for cold water adapted species may be reduced under climate change. Riparian tree planting is a practical climate change mitigation measure, but it is often unclear where to focus effort for maximum beneﬁt. Recent developments in data collection, monitoring and statistical methods have facilitated the development of increasingly sophisticated river temperature models capable of predicting spatial variability at large scales appropriate to management. In parallel, improvements in temporal river temperature models have increased the accuracy of temperature predictions at individual sites. This study developed a novel large scale spatio-temporal model of maximum daily river temperature (Twmax) for Scotland that predicts variability in both river temperature and climate sensitivity. Twmax was modelled as a linear function of maximum daily air temperature (Tamax), with the slope and intercept allowed to vary as a smooth function of day of the year (DoY) and further modiﬁed by landscape covariates including elevation, channel orientation and riparian woodland. Spatial correlation in Twmax was modelled at two scales; (1) river network (2) regional. Temporal correlation was addressed through an autoregressive (AR1) error structure for observations within sites. Additional site level variability was modelled with random effects. The resulting model was used to map (1) spatial variability in predicted Twmax under current (but extreme) climate conditions (2) the sensitivity of rivers to climate variability and (3) the effects of riparian tree planting. These visualisations provide innovative tools for informing ﬁsheries and land-use management under current and future climate.},

	abstract = {Integrated population modelling is widely used in statistical ecology. It allows data from population time series and independent surveys to be analysed simultaneously. In classical analysis the time-series likelihood component can be conveniently approximated using Kalman filter methodology. However, the natural way to model systems which have a discrete state space is to use hidden Markov models (HMMs). The proposed method avoids the Kalman filter approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. Subject to possible numerical sensitivity analysis, it is exact, flexible, and allows the use of standard techniques of classical inference. We apply the approach to data on Little owls, where the model is shown to require a one-dimensional state space, and Northern lapwings, with a two-dimensional state space. In the former example the method identifies a parameter redundancy which changes the perception of the data needed to estimate immigration in integrated population modelling. The latter example may be analysed using either first- or second-order HMMs, describing numbers of one-year olds and adults or adults only, respectively. The use of first-order chains is found to be more efficient, mainly due to the smaller number of one-year olds than adults in this application. For the lapwing modelling it is necessary to group the states in order to reduce the large dimension of the state space. Results check with Bayesian and Kalman filter analyses, and avenues for future research are identified.},

	abstract = {Southern elephant seals breed at Pen´ınsula Valde´s (PV, Argentina) along 200 km of coastline. Annual pup counts at peak breeding season for the entire colony increased from 12,113 in 1995 to 14,350 in 2006. Two demographic subunits were identiﬁed in the North and South of PV with different trends in births numbers, sex ratios and harem sizes. Birth numbers increased in the South, but decreased sharply in the North. To explain the trends in the colony and subunits, a population model was proposed that integrates social structure (harem size and sex ratio) in a fertility function that quantiﬁes the effects of the social structure on the number of births. We found that a better ﬁt to census data results from our model compared to a linear one (␹12 = 4.027, P = 0.045). The model was then used to test alternative hypotheses about the role of recruitment and migration on the dynamic of the two subunits. Results indicated the relevance of considering social structure in population models of gregarious and polygynous species, and is an additional tool for comparative studies between populations of elephant seals where long term census are available.},

	abstract = {Monitoring programs are an essential tool for assessing and informing conservation efforts but the methods used to gather monitoring data directly influence results. This presents a challenge to conservation professionals when deciding on existing data to inform a given question. We illustrate the challenges of using monitoring data by comparing population trends from two large–scale avian monitoring programs in the western United States: the Breeding Bird Survey and Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions programs. We used publicly available data to compare trend trajectory between 2008–2015 for 148 species across Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. Trends were inconsistent for 62\% of the comparisons, with species having opposite trends in 21 cases. The inconsistencies found within our species comparisons reflect the inherent differences between program sampling design and analytical approach. Periodically revisiting how and why we monitor natural resources is necessary to advance conservation and management as the lessons learned from long–standing programs guide the development of more recent efforts. Our results emphasize that prior to management actions and policy decisions, managers must be aware of both the sampling design and appropriate ecological inference of any monitoring program.},

At 6 wind farms, active noise mitigation systems (NMS) were applied during most piling events, and 1 was constructed without. Based on generalized additive modelling analyses, we describe a clear gradient in the decline of porpoise detections after piling, depending on noise level and distance to piling. Declines were found at sound levels exceeding 143 dB re 1 µPa2s (the sound exposure level exceeded during 5\% of piling time, SEL05) and up to 17 km from piling. When only considering piling events with NMS, the maximum effect distance was 14 km. Compared to 24−48 h before piling, porpoise detections declined more strongly during unmitigated piling events at all distances: at 10−15 km declines were around 50\% during piling without NMS, but only 17\% when NMS were applied. Within the vicinity (up to about 2 km) of the construction site, porpoise detections declined several hours before the start of piling and were reduced for about 1−2 d after piling, while at the maximum effect distance, avoidance was only found during the hours of piling. The application of first generation NMS thus reduced the effect range of pile driving and led to a lower decline of porpoise detections over all distances. However, NMS were still under development and did not always work with equal efficiency. As NMS have further developed since, future investigations are expected to show additional reduction of disturbance effects.},

	abstract = {Recently developed capture-mark-recapture methods allow us to account for capture heterogeneity among individuals in the form of discrete mixtures and continuous individual random effects. In this article, we used simulations and two case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of continuously distributed individual random effects at removing potential bias due to capture heterogeneity, and to evaluate in what situation the added complexity of these models is justified. Simulations and case studies showed that ignoring individual capture heterogeneity generally led to a small negative bias in survival estimates and that individual random effects effectively removed this bias. As expected, accounting for capture heterogeneity also led to slightly less precise survival estimates. Our case studies also showed that accounting for capture heterogeneity increased in importance towards the end of study. Though ignoring capture heterogeneity led to a small bias in survival estimates, such bias may greatly impact management decisions. We advocate reducing potential heterogeneity at the sampling design stage. Where this is insufficient, we recommend modelling individual capture heterogeneity in situations such as when a large proportion of the individuals has a low detection probability (e.g. in the presence of floaters) and situations where the most recent survival estimates are of great interest (e.g. in applied conservation).},

	abstract = {Classical regression model literature has generally assumed that measured and unmeasured covariates are statistically independent. For many applications, this assumption is clearly tenuous. When unobservables are associated with included regressors and have an impact on the response, standard estimation methods will not be valid. This means that estimation results from observational studies, whose aim is to evaluate the impact of a treatment of interest on a response variable, will be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unmeasured confounders. One method for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects when dealing with linear models is the instrumental variable (IV) approach. Linear models have been extended to generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), and although IV methods have been proposed to deal with GLMs, ﬁtting methods to carry out IV analysis within the GAM context have not been developed. We propose a simple but effective two-stage procedure for IV estimation when dealing with GAMs represented using any penalized regression spline approach and a correction procedure for conﬁdence intervals. We explain under which conditions the proposed method works and illustrate its empirical validity through an extensive simulation experiment and a health study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present.},

Data were collected during dedicated aerial surveys conducted year-round between 2002 and 2006 following line transect methodology. Survey effort amounted to 44 739 km during which a total of 5121 harbour porpoises was detected, including 258 calves. Our data suggest that porpoises move to distinct areas on a seasonal basis as their biological requirements change. They move into German waters in early spring, reach high numbers in early summer and move out of the area in autumn. The abundance estimates for the German exclusive economic zone and 12 n mile zone were highest in spring (55 048 animals; 95\% CI: 32 395 to 101 671) and summer (49 687 animals; 95\% CI: 29 009 to 96 385) and lowest in autumn with 15 394 animals (95\% CI: 8906 to 29 470). Important aggregation zones were detected in offshore waters: in spring, 2 hot spots, Borkum Reef Ground and Sylt Outer Reef (SOR), were identified as key foraging areas. In summer, only the large hot spot SOR persisted, causing a strong north–south density gradient. In autumn, porpoises were more evenly distributed. Most mother-calf pairs were observed during spring and summer in the SOR, underlining its importance as a foraging area when reproductive costs are high. Spatial overlap exists between important areas for porpoises and areas where offshore wind farms are currently licensed or planned. The proportion of the national stock possibly exposed to the construction noise of 18 licensed wind farms was estimated applying different scenarios. Within a 20 km zone of responsiveness — as worst case scenario — 39\% of the harbour porpoise stock in the German EEZ could be affected during construction.},

Echolocation-click trains were categorized into four phases of the diel cycle: morning, day, evening, and night. Porpoises were present near (,200 m) the platform, and there was a pronounced diel pattern in echolocation activity; the number of porpoise encounters (visits) was greater by night than by day. The number of click trains with a minimum interclick interval of ,10 ms also increased at night. This was conﬁrmed by a comparison of the ratios of feeding buzzes to searchphase clicks (feeding buzz ratios) and an analysis of the changes in pulse-repetition frequencies within each train. A reasonable interpretation of this pattern was that porpoises were feeding below or around the platform at night. The evidence for changes in activity during the morning and evening was less clear, so these may be transitional phases. The pattern of porpoise-echolocation behaviour around this platform is related most probably to the diel activity of their prey. If porpoises cluster regularly around such installations within 500-m shipping exclusion zones, they may be omitted from population surveys. We conclude that offshore installations may play an important role as nocturnal porpoise-feeding stations in an overﬁshed environment, but that further replicated and controlled studies are required. These ﬁndings should be taken into consideration during offshore-installation-decommissioning decisions in the North Sea.},

In many cases, especially when classes are deﬁned by a continuous variable, such as length or mass, there are no natural breakpoints, and the division is artiﬁcial. We introduce the ‘‘integral projection model,’’ which eliminates the need for division into discrete classes, without requiring any additional biological assumptions. Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size. We describe a method for ﬁtting the model to data, and we apply this method to data on an endangered plant species, northern monkshood (Aconitum noveboracense), with individuals classiﬁed by stem diameter. The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, but the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes. The integral projection model avoids this problem and yields size-speciﬁc sensitivities that are not affected by stage duration. These general properties of the integral projection model will make it advantageous for other populations where there is no natural division of individuals into stage classes.},

We ﬁtted a ﬁnite mixture distribution model to the length-frequency data to estimate the proportion population for three delineated age–sex classes (juveniles, adult females, and adult males) and mean length for juveniles and adult males. Estimated proportions reﬂected what we expected; however, the broad region within the western DPS exhibiting substantial population declines had greater proportion of all age–sex classes on rookery sites than increasing broad region. Adult sea lions were signiﬁcantly shorter in the eastern DPS than the western area, providing further evidence of morphological differences between the DPSs.

	abstract = {There is increasing concern about the potential effects of noise pollution on marine life in the world’s oceans. For marine mammals, anthropogenic sounds may cause behavioral disruption, and this can be quantified using a risk function that relates sound exposure to a measured behavioral response. Beaked whales are a taxon of deep diving whales that may be particularly susceptible to naval sonar as the species has been associated with sonar-related mass stranding events. Here we derive the first empirical risk function for Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) by combining in situ data from passive acoustic monitoring of animal vocalizations and navy sonar operations with precise ship tracks and sound field modeling. The hydrophone array at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, Bahamas, was used to locate vocalizing groups of Blainville’s beaked whales and identify sonar transmissions before, during, and after Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar operations. Sonar transmission times and source levels were combined with ship tracks using a sound propagation model to estimate the received level (RL) at each hydrophone. A generalized additive model was fitted to data to model the presence or absence of the start of foraging dives in 30-minute periods as a function of the corresponding sonar RL at the hydrophone closest to the center of each group. This model was then used to construct a risk function that can be used to estimate the probability of a behavioral change (cessation of foraging) the individual members of a Blainville’s beaked whale population might experience as a function of sonar RL. The function predicts a 0.5 probability of disturbance at a RL of 150dBrms re mPa (CI: 144 to 155) This is 15dB lower than the level used historically by the US Navy in their risk assessments but 10 dB higher than the current 140 dB step-function.},

	abstract = {The population size of many species, particularly those in the aquatic environment, cannot be censused directly. Counts, during the breeding season, of one component of the population (e.g. breeding females) are often used as an index to allow investigation of trends. In species, such as grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), for which births are not tightly synchronous, single counts of pups represent an unknown proportion of the total number of pups born (pup production), and thus of breeding females (i.e. each pup born represents a breeding female). Grey seals pup at large colonies around the coast of the UK. Information on their populations is required under national and international legislation. In the UK, pup production has been monitored at some colonies since 1956. Currently, large colonies ( 90\% of UK pup production) are monitored either using ground ( 10\%; annually) or aerial surveys ( 80\%; annually until 2010, and thereafter biennially). Here, the model used to estimate pup production at aerially surveyed colonies from 1987 to 2010 is described; structured pup counts from multiple surveys are combined with knowledge of life-history parameters to model birth curves. The resulting trends in pup production up to 2010 (aerially surveyed colonies) and 2016 (ground surveyed colonies) are examined. In 2010, over 45,000 pups were estimated to be born in the UK. Pup production appeared to have reached an asymptote in the Inner Hebrides, Outer Hebrides and Orkney, whereas it is still increasing exponentially in the North Sea. Although density-dependent processes acting at sea are likely to be responsible for these regional trends, we suggest that the substantial variation in trends within regions are likely caused by processes acting at the colony level. Some long-established colonies, including Special Areas of Conservation, are exhibiting decreasing trends. Special Areas of Conservation often serve as de facto monitoring sites and are the focus of management efforts. The observed temporal and spatial variability in patterns of colony growth rates highlight the potential risks of using such sites to develop wider management policies.},

	abstract = {Beaked whales have mass stranded during some naval sonar exercises, but the cause is unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville’s beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2–3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2–3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 mPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.},

	abstract = {Some beaked whale species are susceptible to the detrimental effects of anthropogenic noise. Most studies have concentrated on the effects of military sonar, but other forms of acoustic disturbance (e.g. shipping noise) may disrupt behavior. An experiment involving the exposure of target whale groups to intense vessel-generated noise tested how these exposures influenced the foraging behavior of Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) in the Tongue of the Ocean (Bahamas). A military array of bottom-mounted hydrophones was used to measure the response based upon changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of vocalizations. The archived acoustic data were used to compute metrics of the echolocation-based foraging behavior for 16 targeted groups, 10 groups further away on the range, and 26 nonexposed groups. The duration of foraging bouts was not significantly affected by the exposure. Changes in the hydrophone over which the group was most frequently detected occurred as the animals moved around within a foraging bout, and their number was significantly less the closer the whales were to the sound source. Non-exposed groups also had significantly more changes in the primary hydrophone than exposed groups irrespective of distance. Our results suggested that broadband ship noise caused a significant change in beaked whale behavior up to at least 5.2 kilometers away from the vessel. The observed change could potentially correspond to a restriction in the movement of groups, a period of more directional travel, a reduction in the number of individuals clicking within the group, or a response to changes in prey movement.},

Beaked whale clicks were automatically detected and manually verified to ensure they fit characteristics of foraging echolocation clicks. Verified foraging click detections were spatially and temporally clustered to represent group vocal periods (GVPs) of beaked whale foraging dives. More GVPs were detected before training events than during or after the training events, and GVPs were detected more on hydrophones at the edges and in the southern portion of the range during sonar activity. However, there were also interannual differences in GVP counts across training event phases, indicating that baseline variability in Blainville’s beaked whale GVPs must be distinguished from reduced foraging dive activity during training events with sonar activity to understand the true impact of sonar.},

Group vocal period (GVP) detections were analyzed for temporal (intra- and inter-annual and diel) and spatial (depth, slope, and range extent) patterns. A habitat model was developed using those parameters as predictor variables in Blainville’s beaked whale foraging dive distributions. No monthly or annual trends in GVP rates were found, but there was some diel periodicity found in GVP rates related to the lunar cycle. In addition, a strong relationship was found between bathymetric features and GVP rates, with most dives occurring over steep slopes and depths between 2,000 and 3,000 m. While GVPs occurred across the range throughout each year, they were concentrated in those areas of preferred habitat. GVP rates were also compared against Navy training activity to assess whether foraging behavior was affected by active sonar or explosive sounds. Similar to other Navy ranges, biannual multi-day training events did decrease GVP rates, but all of the other training activity did not appear to affect GVP rates over sampling periods of a week to a month. These results are the first description of baseline foraging behavior for Blainville’s beaked whales at PMRF and provide some insight into the habitat use patterns related to both the natural environment and anthropogenic impacts.},

This represents one of the largest samples of beaked whales individually tracked during sonar operations (n = 7). The majority of individuals (five of seven) were displaced 28–68 km after the onset of sonar exposure and returned to the AUTEC range 2–4 days after exercises ended. Modeled sound pressure received levels were available during the tracking of four individuals and three of those individuals showed declines from initial maxima of 145–172 dB re 1 μPa to maxima of 70–150 dB re 1 μPa following displacements. Dive behavior data from tags showed a continuation of deep diving activity consistent with foraging during MFAS exposure periods, but also suggested reductions in time spent on deep dives during initial exposure periods. These data provide new insights into behavioral responses to MFAS and have important implications for modeling the population consequences of disturbance.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the ecology and behaviour of species within the family Ziphiidae. In this paper, five aspects of beaked whale ecology and behaviour are reviewed in relation to possible anthropogenic impacts upon them: social structure; life history; foraging/diving ecology; form and function of beaked whale sounds; and habitat characteristics. Differences in social structure within and between species may affect how anthropogenic activities affect local populations. Life history parameters may likewise vary within and between species and may influence the extent of and ability to recovery from population level impacts. Foraging and diving ecology determine where beaked whales spend most of their time and therefore, where in the water column they are most likely to encounter anthropogenic activities. The form and function of beaked whale sounds may be important in determining whether and how beaked whales are affected by anthropogenic noise. Finally, habitat characteristics determine whether beaked whales are likely to occur in a specific area where anthropogenic activities are to be undertaken and may also determine exactly how beaked whales are affected by it within a local area. To help fill the gaps in our knowledge of beaked whale behaviour and ecology, available opportunities for data collection must be maximised. This includes greater levels of co-operation between research groups to build up large datasets, the use of platforms of opportunity to study beaked whales in areas where little research has previously been undertaken and maximising the amount of information that can be learned from each possible source of data, such as stranded animals, through co-ordinated national and international research programmes.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06013},
	abstract = {Distance sampling is a widely used method for estimating wildlife population abundance. The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly design-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be estimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at survey stratum level. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is desirable to estimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal variation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process generating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and propose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The method adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by explanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density models and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We estimate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen shipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale density is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and although there is some positive association between density and mean annual temperature, our estimates are consitent with no trend in density across years. Our analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured variation in density that is not explained by available covariates.},

We represent shape constrained model components by mildly non-linear extensions of P-splines. Models can contain multiple shape constrained and unconstrained terms as well as shape constrained multi-dimensional smooths. The constraints considered are on the sign of the ﬁrst or/and the second derivatives of the smooth terms. A key advantage of the approach is that it facilitates efﬁcient estimation of smoothing parameters as an integral part of model estimation, via GCV or AIC, and numerically robust algorithms for this are presented. We also derive simulation free approximate Bayesian conﬁdence intervals for the smooth components, which are shown to achieve close to nominal coverage probabilities. Applications are presented using real data examples including the risk of disease in relation to proximity to municipal incinerators and the association between air pollution and health.},

	abstract = {Certain anthropogenic sounds are widely believed to cause strandings of beaked whales, but their impacts on beaked whale populations are not known and methods for mitigating their effects are largely untested. The sound sources that have been coincident with beaked whale strandings are military, mid-frequency sonar (2-10kHz) and airgun arrays, both of which are used widely throughout the world for defence and geophysical exploration, respectively and for which alternative technologies are not readily available. Avoidance of beaked whale habitats is superficially a straightforward means of reducing the potential effects, but beaked whales are widely distributed and can be found in virtually all deep-water marine habitats that are free of ice. Some areas of high beaked whale abundance have been identified, but the geographic distribution is poorly known for most species. Beaked whales are both visually and acoustically difficult to detect. Commonly used mitigation measures (e.g. ‘ramp-up’ and ‘detection-modification-avoidance’) have not been assessed for their effectiveness. Surveys to detect population-level impacts would likely require many years of regular monitoring and for most areas where beaked whale strandings have occurred, there are no pre-exposure estimates of population sizes. Risk assessment models can be used to estimate the sound levels to which beaked whales might be exposed under a variety of scenarios, however, the lack of information on the causal mechanism for soundrelated beaked whale strandings makes it difficult to identify exposure levels that would warrant mitigative actions. Controlled exposure experiments, which measure the behavioural responses of animals to fully characterised sound sources, may hold the greatest potential for understanding the behavioural responses of beaked whales to sound and for designing mitigation methods to avoid future impacts.},

	abstract = {Data from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of Navy training ranges can be used to test predictions of marine mammal responsiveness to naval sonar from experimental behavioral response studies. Minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) vocalizations were detected, classified, localized, and associated into individual tracks from data collected on bottom-mounted hydrophones on the U.S. Navy’s Paciﬁc Missile Range Facility located off Kauai, Hawaii. Data were analyzed from before, during, and after naval undersea warfare training activities in February 2014 and February 2017. The spatial distribution of acoustically derived whale tracks was modelled using “latitude,” “longitude,” “depth,” “year,” and “phase” (Before, During, and After) as covariates. It was found that, as well as inter-annual variability across all phases, the distribution of calling whales changed in both years, with fewer tracks in the vicinity of the center of ship activity in the During phase compared with the Before phase. This redistribution of calls extended for approximately five days after the end of the training activity in both years. As the data are from PAM, it is unknown whether this change in the probability of acoustic presence across the range is a result of whales moving away from the range or ceasing calling, or perhaps a combination of both. The expectation from experimental studies is that minke whales will exhibit avoidance in response to naval sonar activity. We conclude that this is a probable explanation for the results reported here, particularly given the nature of the redistribution (an increase in some areas distant from the center of ship activity coincident with a decrease near the center) and the time taken for the distribution observed in the Before phase to re-establish in the After phase of both years.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a unified framework for simultaneously analyzing data sets of different types to estimate vital rates, population size, and dynamics; assess contributions of demographic parameters to population changes; and assess population viability. Strengths of an IPM include the ability to estimate latent parameters and improve the precision of parameter estimates. We present a hierarchical IPM that combines two broad-s­cale avian monitoring data sets: count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and capture–recapture data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program. These data sets are characterized by large numbers of sample sites and observers, factors capable of inducing error in the sampling and observation ­processes. The IPM integrates the data sets by modeling the population abundance as a ­first-o­ rder autoregressive function of the previous year’s population abundance and vital rates. BBS counts were modeled as a log-­linear function of the annual index of population ­abundance, observation effects (observer identity and first survey year), and overdispersion. Vital rates modeled included adult apparent survival, estimated from a transient ­Cormack-J­olly-S­ eber model using MAPS data, and recruitment (surviving hatched birds from the previous season + dispersing adults) estimated as a latent parameter. An assessment of the IPM demonstrated it could recover true parameter values from 200 simulated data sets. The IPM was applied to data sets (1992–2008) of two bird species, Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) in the New England/Mid-­Atlantic coastal Bird Conservation Region of the United States. The Gray Catbird population was relatively stable (trend +0.4\% per yr), while the Wood Thrush population nearly halved (trend −4.5\% per yr) over the 17-­yr study period. IPM estimates of population growth rates, adult survival, and detection and residency probabilities were similar and as precise as estimates from the stand-­alone BBS and CJS models. A benefit of using the IPM was its ability to e­ stimate the latent recruitment parameter. Annual growth rates for both species correlated more with recruitment than survival, and the relationship for Wood Thrush was stronger than for Gray Catbird. The IPM’s unified modeling framework facilitates integration of these important data sets.},

	abstract = {Mass stranding of several species of beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) associated with exposure to anthropogenic sounds has raised concern for the conservation of these species. However, little is known about the species’ life histories, prey or habitat requirements. Without this knowledge, it becomes difficult to assess the effects of anthropogenic sound, since there is no way to determine whether the disturbance is impacting the species’ physical or environmental requirements. Here we take a bioenergetics approach to address this gap in our knowledge, as the elusive, deep-diving nature of beaked whales has made it hard to study these effects directly. We develop a model for Ziphiidae linking feeding energetics to the species’ requirements for survival and reproduction, since these life history traits would be the most likely to be impacted by nonlethal disturbances. Our models suggest that beaked whale reproduction requires energy dense prey, and that poor resource availability would lead to an extension of the inter-calving interval. Further, given current information, it seems that some beaked whale species require relatively high quality habitat in order to meet their requirements for survival and reproduction. As a result, even a small non-lethal disturbance that results in displacement of whales from preferred habitats could potentially impact a population if a significant proportion of that population was affected. We explored the impact of varying ecological parameters and model assumptions on survival and reproduction, and find that calf and fetus survival appear more readily affected than the survival of adult females.},
