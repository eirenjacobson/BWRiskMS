# 4 Discussion

We used a series of three linked models to quantify the response of Blainville's beaked whales to naval training exercises involving MFAS: the first model was fitted to pre-exercise baseline data, the second was fitted to data collected when naval training exercises were ongoing but no MFAS was present, and the third model was fitted to data collected during naval training exercises that used MFAS.  We found that the probability of acoustic detections of Blainville's beaked whales decreased when both naval training exercises and naval training exercises using MFAS were present. 

The data used in this study are from an undesigned experiment, where the spatial intensity of the treatments (naval activity and MFAS) were not applied randomly with respect to either the study area or Blainville's beaked whale presence.  We did not want the spatial distribution of training exercises and MFAS to influence our understanding of the baseline spatial distribution of Blainville's beaked whales.  Therefore, we chose not to fit a single model to the full dataset.    Due to the spatial non-independence of animal distribution and naval training activity, fitting a single model to all of the data would lead to underestimates of the impact of sonar.

In comparison to the risk function developed by Moretti et al. 2014 for Blainville's beaked whales at AUTEC, our risk function predicts a more intense response to naval sonar.  This may be because Moretti et al. were not able to explicitly account for the effects of naval training activities that did not include MFAS.  Their baseline period consisted of 19 hours of data before the onset of MFAS; as at PMRF, it is likely that training activities during this period included sound sources other than MFAS.  Therefore, their risk function is probably more analagous to our expected change in the probability of a detection when MFAS is present relative to when naval training activity was present (Fig. 4).  

From Liz: Then we can discuss the fact that environment/habitat (e.g. deep basin with shallow slopes all around vs deep open ocean) doesn’t seem to play much of a role in Blainville’s response, and the response seems to be more of an intrinsic characterisitic. Also can mention here the same effort at SCORE with Cuvier’s – in light of these results we expect similar results there even though different species but similar habitat to AUTEC. [389]

- Discuss dose-response and p(disturbance) in context of [@tyack_using_2019] 

- Emphasize novelty -- more sophisticated method, and can be applied to other species and regions

- plans to investigate what aspects of general training activity is eliciting a response.
