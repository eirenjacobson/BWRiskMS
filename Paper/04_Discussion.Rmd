- Describe why we didn't use a single giant GAM -- didn't want contamination of the baseline period by the spatial distribution of sonar, would lead to underestimates of the impact of sonar. Could present the single giant GAM in an appendix.

- Discuss unusual timeline of Feb13

- Discuss what "Naval activity" could mean

- GVPs appear to decrease over the course of MFA sonar; this is something we could investigate with a spatio-temporal model in teh future (hour since onset of MFA?  SEL?)
