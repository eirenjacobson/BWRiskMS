# Discussion

We used a series of three linked models to quantify the response of Blainville's beaked whales to naval training exercises involving MFAS: the first model was fitted to pre-exercise baseline data, the second was fitted to data collected when naval training exercises were ongoing but no MFAS was present, and the third model was fitted to data collected during naval training exercises that used MFAS.  We found that the probability of acoustic detections of Blainville's beaked whales decreased when both naval training exercises and naval training exercises using MFAS were present (Fig. \@ref(fig:deltaships) and \@ref(fig:deltabaseline)).

The methods presented here are spatially-explicit and account for the spatial confounding of animal distribution and naval training activity.  The data used in this study are from an undesigned experiment, where the spatial intensity of the treatments (naval activity and MFAS) were not applied randomly with respect to either the study area or Blainville's beaked whale presence.  We did not want the spatial distribution of training exercises and MFAS to influence our understanding of the baseline spatial distribution of Blainville's beaked whales. Due to the spatial confounding of animal distribution and naval training activity at PMRF, fitting a single model to all of the data would lead to underestimates of the impact of sonar, since changes in distribution due to MFAS could be explained as spatial changes by the MRF (Appendix S3). Our three-stage modelling approach addresses this issue while propagating uncertainty between the models.

The analytical approach outlined in this article could be applied to other species, regions, and types of disturbance where experimental design is not possible. The use of Markov random fields for the spatial term is useful for cases where exact distance data is not available, avoiding the use of continuous smoothers when true location data is not available. Shape-constrained smoothing is also well-suited to the kind of data we model here -- ensuring that values can only stay constant or decrease over time (or any other covariate). Finally, the use of a multi-stage posterior sampling scheme extends to any situation where multiple models are fitted and the results of one part feed into another. Simulation-based approaches such as these bypass the need to derive (often complex) expressions (or shortcut them by assuming independence). We provide example code as Supplementary Material so that other researchers may apply and/or expand on these methods.

In a regulatory context, a dose-response function as presented in Figs. 4 and 5 is often interpreted as representing the proportion of a population that responds (y-axis) to a given received level (x-axis) [@tyack_using_2019].  However, the metric used in this study -- the change in the probability of detecting a GVP within a half-hour period -- does not directly correspond to the proportion of the population that is affected.  Rather, it may reflect a change in the proportion of time spent foraging, which affects the entire population.  These two interpretations have different implications for understanding sub-lethal impacts of MFAS.  In the traditional interpretation, given exposure to a certain received level, some of the population is affected and some of the population is not.  In our interpretation, the entire exposed population is affected. 

In comparison to the risk function developed by Moretti et al. [-@moretti_risk_2014] for Blainville's beaked whales at AUTEC, our risk function predicts a more intense response to naval sonar.  This may be because Moretti et al. were not able to explicitly account for the effects of naval training activities that did not include MFAS.  Their baseline period consisted of 19 hours of data before the onset of MFAS; as at PMRF, it is likely that training activities during this period included sound sources other than MFAS.  Therefore, their risk function is probably more analagous to our expected change in the probability of a detection when MFAS is present relative to when naval training activity was present (Fig. \@ref(fig:deltaships)).  

In future, we would like to further investigate the specific causes of changes in the probability of detecting GVPs before the onset of MFAS.  The reduction in detection of foraging dives could be a response to general Naval training activity on the range, or to specific sound sources that have not previously been studied.  Alternatively, it is possible that Blainville's beaked whales are semi-resident on the range and have become habituated to SCC activity; they may move off the range in anticipation of MFAS. 

The AUTEC range is located in the Tongue of the Ocean (TOGO) off the island of Andros in The Bahamas, in a deep basin bounded to the south, east, and west by shallow waters and with maximum depths of 2000 m. In contrast, PMRF is located to the northwest of the island of Kauai and occurs across a steep slope and into deep water, over 5000 m in depth. Although the environments at PMRF and AUTEC are different, the foraging dive behavior of Blainville’s beaked whales is similar at AUTEC and PMRF; dives occur in deeper waters over steep slopes with gradients ranging from 3-23\%, although dives occur in deeper waters [2000-3000 m; @henderson_occurrence_2016] at PMRF that at AUTEC [500-1300 m; @macleod_habitat_2005, @hazen_relationship_2011]. Resident Blainville’s beaked whales off the Big Island also occur in slightly shallower waters than at PMRF, from 980-1410 m [@baird_diel_2008; @baird_short_2011]. Therefore it is likely the location of the mesopelagic scattering layer along the slope that drives the location of Blainville’s beaked whales rather than the bathymetric depth; this is supported by the fact that dive depths are similar across areas, occurring on average down to 1050-1150 m for 46-60 min [@baird_diel_2008; @schorr_movements_2009; @joyce_physiological_2017).

Similarly, responses to MFAS activity are comparable at both ranges, with individuals and groups moving to the periphery of the range or off the range and returning 2-4 days after the cessation of the sonar [@mccarthy_changes_2011; @manzano-roth_impacts_2016; @joyce_behavioral_2019]. Tagged individuals that were to the north of AUTEC at the onset of sonar moved 27 – 43 km away from the edge of the range; the individual that was south of the range initially moved south but may have been trapped by the shallow water at the edge of the basin and so turned north towards the range, then south again [@joyce_behavioral_2019]. In contrast, Blainville’s beaked whales at PMRF can easily move away from the range in any direction without impediment. While no Blainville’s beaked whales have been tagged at PMRF, they have been tagged off the Big Island and the resident, island-associated animals appear to remain relatively close to shore, with median distances of 4-27 km [@schorr_movements_2009]. These resident animals may also travel to other islands as well [@wursig_behavior_2019], unlike Blainville’s beaked whales in the Bahamas where no animals have been photo-identifed at both AUTEC and the nearby island of Abaco [@claridge_population_2013]. However, two Blainville’s beaked whales have been tagged off the Big Island that moved away into deep water; these may represent offshore animals that are also found in Hawaiian waters [@baird_diel_2008; @baird_short_2011; @wursig_behavior_2019]. Resident animals that are frequently exposed to training activity and transient animals that only encounter MFAS occasionally are likely to respond differently to sonar; it is not known how resident the Blainville’s beaked whales are at PMRF, and there may be offshore animals as well found on the northern hydrophones. Regardless, the similarities in Blainville’s beaked whale behavioral responses to Navy training activity across different ranges and environments and at similar received levels may indicate the intrinsic nature of the response. Conducting a similar analysis of Cuvier’s beaked whale responses at the Southern California Anti-Submarine Warfare Range (SOAR) would further support this assessment; existing findings already demonstrate that Cuvier’s respond in a similar manner by reducing their foraging dives and moving away from the ensonified area [@falcone_diving_2017; @deruiter_first_2013-1].
