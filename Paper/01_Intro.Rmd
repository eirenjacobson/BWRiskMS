# 1 Introduction

Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are a group of deep-diving cetaceans that rely on sound to forage, navigate, and communicate [@macleod_review_2006; @johnson_beaked_2004; @aguilar_de_soto_no_2012].  Multiple mass strandings of beaked whales have been associated with high-intensity anthropogenic sound sources.  These acute events have motivated research into whether and how beaked whales respond to different types and intensities of anthropogenic noise [@cox_understanding_2006].

Anthropogenic sound can disrupt the patterned dive cycles of these animals [CITE e.g. Falcone, also Southall re syncrhronicity?], potentially leading to death [CITE Jepson] or to cumulative sublethal impacts [PCoD, CITE].  For example, research on Blainville's beaked whales \textit{Mesoplodon densirostris} on a Navy range in the Bahamas has shown that animals may stop foraging and/or move away from sonar sources [@tyack_beaked_2011; @joyce_behavioral_2019].

Naval sonar can be broadcast from various platforms, including vessels, helicopters, buoys, submarines, and autonomous vehicles (or should this say torpedoes?) (CITE?).  Most research has focused on the impacts of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar broadcast from Naval vessels, but has not been able to isolate the effect of the Naval vessels themselves.  Separately, researchers have shown that, in the absence of MFA sonar, beaked whales may alter their behavior in response to vessel noise [@aguilar_soto_does_2006; @pirotta_vessel_2012].  

There are different experimental and analytical ways of quantifying responses to sonar.  Here, we focus on methods used for analysis of data from cabled hydrophone arrays.

For example, [@mccarthy_changes_2011] used separate GAMS for before/during/after, response was GVPs per 5 hr periods, explanatory vars were inner/outer and time. Hypotheses were evaluated using z-tests.

[@moretti_risk_2014] used a GAM to model dive presence/absence as a function of a smooth on sonar RL.  They and compared the predicted probability of dive presence at varying RLs to a baseline calculated from pre-sonar data to calculate the probability of disturbance. 

In the present study, we wanted to look at cumulative effects of Naval training activity and MFA sonar while explicitly accounting for differences in underlying beaked whale presence.  We wanted to isolate the effect of training activity from the effect of hull-mounted MFA sonar.  To do this, we used a spatially referenced dataset of Blainville's beaked whales from Hawaii.  Data were collected via a cabled hydrophone array before and during six Naval training exercises.  Previous work in this region has shown that Blainville's beaked whales are present year-round at this site, that they prefer certain slope habitats, and that acoustic detections decrease during multi-day training events [@henderson_occurrence_2016; @manzano-roth_impacts_2016].
