# Introduction

Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are a group of deep-diving cetaceans that rely on sound to forage, navigate, and communicate [@macleod_review_2006; @johnson_beaked_2004; @aguilar_de_soto_no_2012] and are sensitive to anthropogenic noise [@southall_experimental_2016; @hooker_future_2019]. Multiple mass strandings of beaked whales have been associated with high-intensity anthropogenic sound sources, including naval sonar [@damico_beaked_2009; @bernaldo_de_quiros_advances_2019; @simonis_co-occurrence_2020]. These acute events have motivated research into whether and how beaked whales respond to different types and intensities of anthropogenic noise [e.g., @aguilar_de_soto_does_2006; @tyack_beaked_2011; @cholewiak_beaked_2017; @stanistreet_changes_2022]. Anthropogenic sound can disrupt the foraging dive cycles of beaked whales [@falcone_diving_2017], potentially leading to cumulative sublethal impacts resulting from reduced foraging opportunities [@new_using_2013; @pirotta_understanding_2018], or to symptoms similar to decompression sickness that can lead to injury or death [@hooker_could_2009; @hooker_deadly_2012]. 

Echolocation clicks produced by diving groups of Blainville's beaked whales indicate foraging activity and can be recorded by hydrophones [@johnson_foraging_2006]. Research on Blainville's beaked whales \textit{(Mesoplodon densirostris)} using data from bottom-mounted hydrophones on a U.S. Navy range in the Bahamas has shown decreases in time spent foraging and movement away from naval sonar sources [@tyack_beaked_2011; @joyce_behavioral_2019; @mccarthy_changes_2011]. Naval sonar can be broadcast from various platforms, including vessels, helicopters, buoys, submarines, and torpedoes [@us_department_of_the_navy_final_2018]. Most research has focused on the impacts of mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS) broadcast from naval vessels [@falcone_diving_2017]. Separately, researchers have shown that, in the absence of MFAS, beaked whales may alter their behavior in response to vessel noise [@aguilar_de_soto_does_2006; @pirotta_vessel_2012]. 

The U.S. Navy is interested in quantifying the effects of sonar on beaked whales for the purpose of risk assessments and permitting associated with training activities [e.g., @navy2017criteria]. There are different experimental and analytical ways of quantifying responses to sonar [see @harris_marine_2018 for a review]. Here, we focus on analyses of observational data from cabled hydrophone arrays collected concurrently with naval training exercises. Examples of these from previous studies include McCarthy et al. [-@mccarthy_changes_2011] who used data from the cabled hydrophone array at the U.S. Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas collected before, during, and after naval training exercises involving MFAS. The authors used separate generalized additive models (GAMs) for each period, and modelled the acoustic detection of groups of Blainville's beaked whales (group vocal periods; GVPs) as a function of location on the range and time. They found that the number of GVPs was lower during the exercises than before or after. Building on this work, Moretti et al. [-@moretti_risk_2014] used a GAM to examine the presence or absence of GVP starts within 30-min periods (i.e., whether or not a GVP started within each 30-min period) on the AUTEC range as a smooth function of MFAS received level. They compared the expected probability of detecting animals when no sonar was present to the expected probability of detecting animals across sonar received levels to estimate the probability of disturbance. They found that the probability of detecting groups of Blainville's beaked whales was reduced by 50\% at 150\ dB re 1\ $\mu$Pa, which they interpreted as a 50\% probability of disturbance. 

Our primary objective was to replicate the effort of Moretti et al. [-@moretti_risk_2014] with the same species on a different U.S. Navy training range in a different oceanic environment. We used a spatially-referenced data set of Blainville's beaked whale foraging dives recorded at the PMRF off the island of Kauai, Hawaii (Fig. 1). Passive acoustic detections of the presence or absence of GVP starts within 30-min periods were collected via a cabled hydrophone array at PMRF before and during training exercises involving MFAS broadcast from navy ships.

Unlike AUTEC, which is situated in a deep isolated basin surrounded by steep slopes, the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) in Hawaii is located on the side of an ancient volcano, with a steep slope to the deep ocean floor. Previous work in this region has shown that Blainville's beaked whales are present year-round at this site, prefer sloped habitats, and that acoustic detections decrease during multi-day training events involving MFAS [@henderson_occurrence_2016; @manzano-roth_impacts_2016]. As we expected the density of Blainville's beaked whales at PMRF to be low and spatially variable, our methods needed to explicitly account for differences in underlying beaked whale presence across the range. An additional objective was to isolate the effect of general training activity from the effect of MFAS, so that beaked whale response to MFAS could be quantified relative to pre-training baseline periods and to periods when general training activities were present on the range.
