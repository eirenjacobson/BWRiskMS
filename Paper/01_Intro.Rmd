# 1 Introduction

Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are a group of deep-diving cetaceans that rely on sound to forage, navigate, and communicate [@macleod_review_2006; @johnson_beaked_2004; @aguilar_de_soto_no_2012].  Multiple mass strandings of beaked whales have been associated with high-intensity anthropogenic sound sources.  These acute events have motivated research into whether and how beaked whales respond to different types and intensities of anthropogenic noise [@cox_understanding_2006].

These studies have focused on two species (Cuvier's and Blainville's) and two methods (tags and cabled arrays) and two stimulus types (sonar and ship noise)

Anthropogenic sound can disrupt the patterned dive cycles of these animals [CITE e.g. Falcone, also Southall re syncrhronicity?], potentially leading to death [CITE Jepson] or to cumulative sublethal impacts [PCoD, CITE].

- sonar is the worst

[@tyack_beaked_2011]

- but other things also have impacts

[@aguilar_soto_does_2006]

[@pirotta_vessel_2012]

- There are different ways of quantifying how bad it is

[@moretti_risk_2014]

[@mccarthy_changes_2011]

[@tyack_using_2019]

- we wanted to look at combined effects of naval training activity + MFA sonar

 cite some things on additive effects? spatial modelling?

- we used a spatially referenced dataset of Blainville's beaked whales from PMRF
